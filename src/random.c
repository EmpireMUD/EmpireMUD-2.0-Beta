/*
 * I am bothered by the non-portablility of 'rand' and 'random' -- rand
 * is ANSI C, but on some systems such as Suns, rand has seriously tragic
 * spectral properties (the low bit alternates between 0 and 1!).  random
 * is better but isn't supported by all systems.  So, in my quest for Ultimate
 * CircleMUD Portability, I decided to include this code for a simple but
 * relatively effective random number generator.  It's not the best RNG code
 * around, but I like it because it's very short and simple, and for our
 * purposes it's "random enough".
 *               --Jeremy Elson  2/23/95
 *
 * Well, despite autoconf we're back to using this random all the
 * time.  Oh well, there's no harm in changing my mind on this one
 * from release to release...  -JE 10/28/97
 *
 * I've changed the name from circle_random to empire_random to match my
 * new code base, but it's exactly the same.  Nothing new.  -PC 11/06/2k
