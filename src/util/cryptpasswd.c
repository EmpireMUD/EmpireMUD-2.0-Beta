*  file:  cryptpasswd.c                                   EmpireMUD 2.0b3 *
*  Usage: generates an encrypted password for manually editing pfiles     *
*                                                                         *
*  You can edit player's passwords directly in the playerfiles, but they  *
*  are encrypted and to successfully set a password in the file, you      *
*  must use this utility to generate the encrypted form. Use this syntax  *
*  to generate the password:                                              *
*                                                                         *
*  > ./cryptpasswd <plaintext password>                                   *
*                                                                         *
*  NOTE: Editing a pfile while the player is in-game will have no effect  *
*                                                                         *
*  You can also set passwords in-game using "set file <name> password"    *
*                                                                         *
