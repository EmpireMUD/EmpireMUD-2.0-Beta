This document will help you set up and configure your new EmpireMUD. Everything
in this document is just a suggestion. It's your world. Run it however you
like.

=================
 A. WORLD SETUP:
-----------------

Before you start up your EmpireMUD for the first time, generate a map using
the directions in the README file that came with EmpireMUD.

By default, the map generator places 1 starting location (a Tower of Souls) on
the new map. After you start up your EmpireMUD, you should select a few good
locations for more starting locations. You may remove the first one, since the
location that's chosen automatically is not always a good one.

You should create 1 or more newbie islands -- safe places for new players to
learn the game. Choose any small island either by generating a graphical 
version of your map, or using the 'island list' command to find small islands.

A newbie island usually needs these things:
 1. A Tower of Souls (starting location):  .map terrain Tower of Souls
 2. Set the area around the Tower of Souls unclaimable:  .map unclaimable 4
 3. Set the island flags:  island flags <island id> add <flags>
    Suggested flags:
      NEWBIE  - enables newbie adventures and protections
      !AGGRO  - prevents aggro mobs from attacking players
      !CUSTOMIZE  - prevents players from renaming the island

Additional tools:
 - 'show startlocs' - Lists the starting locations.
 - 'config world naturalize_newbie_islands true' - If you want to automatically
   clean up the newbie islands each year.


==================
 B. CONFIGURATION
------------------

Many parts of EmpireMUD can be configured to different settings, for games
that have different sets of rules and limits.

The 'config' command allows you to change these settings in-game. It is split
into multiple categories. You can type 'config world' to see the world configs,
and 'config world -v' if you want an explanation of what they all do.

Suggested configs to set right away:

config game:
 mud_contact - email address of the game admin
 mud_created - set to the current year
 mud_hostname - your domain
 mud_ip - your IP address
 mud_name - the name of your copy of EmpireMUD
 mud_website - a website, if you have one

config approval (if you want to require character approval)
 approve_per_character - each character would require approval, instead of
   each account
 auto_approve - turn this off if you want to require approval
 * - the rest of this category controls which commands require approval


================
 C. ADVENTURES:
----------------

Some adventures require setup once your game is running. Each of these
adventures has notes in its description. You can use 'vstat adv <vnum>' to
see the notes, and you can delete those notes once you finish setup.

The following adventures require setup:
	[   50] Tutorial: Royal Planning Office
	[   51] Tutorial: Museum of Early Man
	[   52] Tutorial Quests
	[  180] Misplaced Mother Goose
	[  181] Goblin Mines
	[18200] The Guild of Adventurers


==========
 D. STAFF
----------

Here are some useful tips about adding staff members:

Advance: You can promote someone to immortal level using 'advance <name> 3'.
The default immortals levels are 3-6.

Restore: You should always 'restore' new immortal staff members, including
yourself. This gives the player all skills and turns off hunger/thirst.

Set: You may want some of the following settings on your staff members:
 multi-ip - Allows multiple accounts to log in from the same IP address.
 multi-char - Allows multiple characters to log in from the same account.
 noidleout - Turns off the automatic logout for being idle.

Grants: You can give lower-level immortals additional powers by giving them
'grants' using 'set <name> grants [add | remove] <flags>'. To see a list of
available grants, type 'set <name> grants' with no other arguments. Most grants
give access to a single command, but type 'help grants' for more information.

OLC: If your staff members will be building content, you can control their
access to this system. More information is available on 'help olc controls'.


===================
 E. ADDING CONTENT
-------------------

EmpireMUD 2.0 includes a full suite of OLC (OnLine Creation) editors that allow
you to edit all facets of the game. You should familiarize yourself with the
following commands and help files:

  . (olc) - The . command controls all the OLC functions.
  vnum - Look up an item/mob/etc by name.
  vstat - Get stats on something by vnum (virtual number).
  BUILDING GUIDE - A help file with general tips on all the editors.
  instance - Control instances of adventures.

If you plan to add new content, you should pick vnums starting at 100000 or
higher, to avoid conflicting with any new stock content that might appear in
future updates.
