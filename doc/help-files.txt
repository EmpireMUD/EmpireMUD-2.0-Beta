HELP FILES

This document includes information on help files and how to add or update them.


========================
 LOCATION OF HELP FILES
========================

Help files are located at:
  empiremud/lib/text/help/*.hlp

To add an entirely new help file, be sure to add it to the index at:
  empiremud/lib/text/help/index


==========================
 STRUCTURE OF A HELP FILE
==========================

Multiple helps can be located in one file. The basic file structure looks like
this:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD KEYWORDS "MULTI-WORD KEYWORDS"

Body of help file. This help can be viewed by all players.

#
KEYWORD KEYWORDS "MULTI-WORD KEYWORDS"

Body of help file. This help can only be viewed by immortals.

$
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


======================
 PARTS OF A HELP FILE
======================

- Each help entry starts with its keywords in all-caps on one line. This line
  cannot exceed 255 characters in length, like all lines in data files. If a
  keyword has multiple words, it must be in quotation marks. This looks like:
  
                    KEYWORD KEYWORDS "MULTI-WORD KEYWORDS"

- After the keywords, the help entry should have a blank line.
- The body of the help entry can contain as much or as little information as
  you like. Review existing help files for standard formatting and information.
- If there are other related helps, end the entry with a blank line and then a
  "See also:" with the keywords of those related helps.
- Each help entry must end with a pound sign (or hash sign), #, on its own
  line. If the help is level-restricted, this is followed by a letter.
- At the very end of the file, after the last help entry, the file must end
  with a dollar sign, $, on its own line.


===========================================
 ACCESS LEVEL RESTRICTIONS ON HELP ENTRIES
===========================================

Helps that are intended only for players with a specific access level may be
restricted by putting a letter after the # at the end of the help entry. Levels
for each letter are:

   #a - Implementor (top level)
   #b - Co-Implementor
   #c - Assistant
   #d - Immortal (lowest admin level)
   #e - Gods (a special player level)
   #f - All players (this no longer has any meaning and can simply be a #)


===============================
 COLOR CODES AND CONTROL CODES
===============================

Help files can contain color codes and other control codes such as &r (red
color). There is a full list of color codes on HELP COLOR.

Help files also support additional control codes. These don't work on all
clients but will show only plain text on ones that don't support it:

   MXP links: &(http://address.com/&) opens the URL when clicked
   MXP in-game links: &(HELP COLOR&) enters the command HELP COLOR when clicked
   MXP clickable text:  &<send href="help wizhelp">click here&</send>
   Unicode characters: &[U9814/Rook] shows unicode char 9814 if supported or
      'Rook' if not.
   Custom colors: &[F123] foreground color and &B[123] background color
      The 3 digits inside the brackets indicate RGB values from 0-5 where
      0 is darkest and 5 is lightest. In order the digits are Red, Green, Blue.


================
 MAKING CHANGES
================

There is no in-game OLC editor for help files. You should edit them with a
plain-text editor. Be sure not to remove the # or $ lines (see above).

After editing help files, you can make these changes live in your game by
typing 'reload xhelp' on an administrator. This will fully reload all helps
without restarting the MUD.

Note: No line in the file, including keywords, may exceed 255 characters in
length.
