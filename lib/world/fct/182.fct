The Guild of Adventurers~
   Long ago, the world's most renowned adventurers banded together to form a
guild whose purpose would transcend the petty differences between empires. 
Today, guildhalls can be found in every great city, on every continent. The
Guild of Adventurers is also known for its atlasian tortoises, monstrous beasts
that carry its legendary guildhalls on their backs. Seek out one such tortoise
to get started with the guild.
