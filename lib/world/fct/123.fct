Serragons~
   Though they're often thought to be mythical, scholars know serragons to be
very rare, very real creatures. Their serpentine shape and massive size lead to
comparisons to dragons, but a serragon is something else entirely. Its most
notable traits are the lack of any arms or legs, like a snake, and sharp
serrations on the edges of its scales, which leave long grooves wherever it
goes.
