That Meddling Knight~
   Though her grunts and snorts are fierce, you find yourself strangely capable
of understanding the colossal red dragon as she tells you the tale of a knight
who won't stop pestering her. It seems dragons do not take kindly to knights
trying to slay them, and this dragon will reward you if you will put an end to
the knight's meddling.
   Seek out Sir Vivor and defeat him in combat, then return to the colossal
red dragon for your reward. You can only complete this quest if you haven't
also done Sir Vivor's quest in the same adventure instance.
~
You have defeated Sir Vivor and earned the dragon's favor.

Slay The Red Dragon~
   Sir Vivor tells you of his epic quest to find and defeat the red dragon who
once destroyed his entire village. Of course, to a lowly knight like Sir Vivor,
all dragons look the same. As such, he has set out to find every red dragon
cave and defeat them all. But as it turns out, Sir Vivor isn't particularly
brave or strong. He needs you to defeat the dragon for him.
   Find the colossal red dragon's cave and defeat the beast, then return to
Sir Vivor for your reward. You can only complete this quest if you haven't
also done the dragon's quest in the same adventure instance.
~
You have slain the dragon! Sir Vivor dances with joy.

The Dragon's Hoard~
   You met a shifty, nervous-looking thief named Bangles. He has a buyer who is
looking for a rare red dragon hoard, but Bangles isn't exactly known for his
ability to sneak about. If you can help Bangles get the hoard, he's willing to
split the profits with you.
   Find the nearby red dragon cave, sneak in, and pickpocket the dragon. Once
you have her hoard, sneak back out and return to Bangles for your reward. You
can complete this quest once per adventure instance, and it doesn't stop you
from also completing the quests given by the dragon or the knight.
   One word of warning: you MUST pickpocket the dragon's hoard to complete this
quest. You're not much of a thief if you have to kill the dragon to get it.
~
You split the dragon's treasure with the thief!
