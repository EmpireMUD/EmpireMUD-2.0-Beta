Nails for the Golden Goblin~
   The pirate ship is practically falling apart. Quartermaster Smeegle asks you
to donate some nails to help them get moving again, in exchange for vague
promises of future gratitude.
~
Smeegle grins from ear to green ear when you hand him the nails.

Find Fathma~
   Smeegle puts his deckhand to work making repairs, but stops and looks
around, puzzled. He shouts for someone named Fathma, but there is no response.
The quartermaster scratches his head and asks you to go figure out where Fathma
has gone.
~
You found Fathma! Now, how do you get out of here?

Seaweed for the Sea Witch~
   Fathma is working on a better water-breathing potion but needs the seaweed
that grows in the caverns. Unfortunately, she can't leave the air bubble
herself. Explore the caverns and 'pick' some seaweed. Fathma has promised to
pay you for it.
~
You hand Fathma the seaweed.

Song of the Deep~
   Fathma needs some unusual ingredients that are rare in the open ocean, but
might be easy to find in this underwater cavern. You'll need to hunt and kill
an orca, a squid, and a mermaid. Return to Fathma with the correct pieces of
each.
~
   Fathma whistles a raspy tune as she takes the reagents and dumps them into
her cauldron.

Fish Food~
   Spellcasting in this cold, dank air bubble is hungry work. Worse, Fathma
tells you it's practically torture to be so close to the stench of fish but
unable to eat any of them. Fillet some fish and cook them into a 'crispy fish'
for Fathma, to keep her going through this spell.
~
   Fathma swallows the crispy fish whole, which makes you question why she
needed you to cook it first.

A Deeper Evil~
   Fathma confides that she came down here not just for seafood and rare
reagents, but to gain the honor of killing a great sea creature. 
Unfortunately, she has been stuck in this air bubble unable to stop casting for
fear of running out of air. But if you kill one of the ocean's legendary
denizens in her name, and she steals the credit, that will be close enough. 
Hunt down one of the great creatures that dwells in these caverns, and slay it
for her.
~
   Rather than thanking you, Fathma pays you and then begins plotting how she
will tell the tale of her heroic conquest of the sea cavern.
