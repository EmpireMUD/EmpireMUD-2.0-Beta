Primeval Portal: Search the Forest~
   The chronomancer seems quite worried about the safety of the base camp. 
After all, the Primeval is a frighteningly unfamiliar and deeply unsettling
time. Whether a dracosaur, terrosaur, or mad sorcerer, the threat outside the
camp must be discovered, measured, and defeated. Track down whichever threat is
most immediate (each Primeval Portal will only have 1 of the 3 boss mobs) and
ensure it is laid to rest.

   The chronomancer looks relieved that the base is safe -- at least, for the
time being.
