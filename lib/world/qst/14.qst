Apprentice Paint-Maker~
   You begin an apprenticeship with the paint-maker. At the end of this
journey, you will be able to redecorate the outside of your buildings. The
painter sends you to learn more about pigments and chemistry at the alchemist.
After that, you'll be able to experiment with your own paints.
Type 'research' at an alchemist or laboratory to learn more.
~
With your newfound knowledge of pigments, you're ready to make some paints...

Experiment With Paints~
   The painter helps you with the instructions for making a simple jar of
paint. Try making an experimental blue paint and using it to paint one of your
buildings. It might take a few tries to get it right.
~
   It looks like you successfully made the blue paint! The painter also teaches
you to make the other primary colors: red and yellow.
