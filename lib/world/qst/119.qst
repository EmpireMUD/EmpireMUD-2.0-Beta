Skycleave: High Sorcery Instruction~
   Instructor Huberus shuffles back and forth across the classroom, loudly
pontificating on topics you can't seem to comprehend. It seems to be a High
Sorcery lesson, but the words are all jumbled.
   Perhaps you have to pay her first... This daily quest will raise your High
Sorcery by at least 1 point if it's under 50. (Make sure you don't have High
Sorcery no-skilled.)
~
   You pay the fee and sit for Instructor Huberus's lesson. Comprehension comes
quickly as you feel your mind expand. For a moment, you can almost see the
magic that underpins reality.

Skycleave: Win a Prize~
   'Things are hectic in here, but be sure to find some time to play the claw
game,' Mageina says to you, over the counter, making a claw motion with her
hand. 'Never know what you're going to get from that. Let me know.'
~
   Mageina sees what you won from the claw game and breathes out a half-laugh
through her nose.
   'Yeah, I've seen those before,' she says. 'Maybe I've seen them all, but
every once in a while, someone comes in with a new one. At least you managed to
find the machine while it was working. It keeps breaking and I can never keep
track of where we are in the...'
   Mageina looks over your shoulder and then leans in close to say, 'Or rather,
WHEN we are, in the time loop.'

Skycleave: Win a Prize from the Claw Game~
   Another day, another trip through the time loop. What does the claw game
have in store this time? The only way to find out is to play it. Win another
prize from the claw game -- if it's in working condition, that is. Otherwise,
you'll need to aid the rescue of the tower in order to give its residents time
to fix it.
~
   'What did you get?' the shopkeeper shouts from behind the counter. He
stretches his neck to peer over, eyes wide and eyebrows up, but his face falls
when he sees your prize.
   'Oh, yeah,' he says. 'It's giving out a lot of those today. Maybe they fixed
it wrong. I tried hitting it a few times, erm, with a bucket, but it didn't
really help much. Still, enjoy your prize... Oh! And thank you for your
established patronage at Towrinkel's, erm, Gift Shop.'

Skycleave: Off to the Races~
   You roll the purple and brown clay jar back and forth. It doesn't feel like
much in your hands, but your heart is practically beating out of your chest as
you imagine catching your own pixy and training it for the Pixy Races!
   Find a pixy, if you can, and catch it in the jar. The salesman suggested
they can be found in enchanted forests but in a pinch, any escaped pixy might
do. If you really want to bond with your pixy, give it a good, quick name. Then
race it at Skycleave's Pixy Races and see how it fares. The more you race, the
better your pixy will get!
~
   'Amazing little thing,' Warden Chicanders says as you load your pixy back
into the jar. 'Well, it could have done better, but it really did show a lot of
promise.'
   The warden rubs the sweat from his long forehead with his palm and then
grabs a parchment to write down the race results. He peers back and forth
across the race domes, scribbling some notes to himself.
   'Oh,' he says at last, looking back down at you. 'Well that was all, unless
you're racing again. Got to get that little pixy into tip-top shape if you want
to be the best there ever was.'

Skycleave: Victory Lap~
   The Tower Skycleave's Pixy Races are rarely open to the public, but your
assistance to its sorcerers has earned you a permanent invitation. What's more,
they've seen you race and are eager to see more. Pick your favorite pixy and
race -- more than race; pick your favorite pixy and win! Show those stuffed
aubergine robes how it's really done.
~
   'I dare say, you seem to know what you're doing,' Warden Chicanders says as
you load your pixy back into the jar. 'Putting the house pixies to shame. Well,
rather a good thing we don't let guests bet on the races anymore.'
   He takes the jar from you for a moment and holds it to the light. You can't
see through it -- it's made of clay, after all -- but the warden seems to be
examinining it. He tosses it back to you, nearly missing, and pulls a parchment
from the sleeve of his robe to scribble some notes.
   'Might have to run mine like that,' he says. 'In some circuits, those moves
might be considered cheating. Old rules, new rules; you could go round and
round about it till the end of time. I say the dirty tricks make it
interesting. Might have to copy some of yours.'

Skycleave: Best There Ever Was~
   Apprentice Ravinder pulls you aside and peers past you before leaning in
close. His eyes flit back and forth over your shoulder, never on you, and his
volume drops whenever someone moves into earshot.
   'I've heard you're quite the racer. Got a pretty good pixy. Thorley said
you're the best in our generation, although he's not in his proper mind, if you
catch my meaning,' Ravinder says under his breath.
   'Let's not mince words. I'm trying to win and I haven't got all the time in
the world to train a good one. So let's see yours. If it's any good, I'll pay
you for it. Simple transaction. I'm sure I can make it worth your time.'
   Train a high-level pixy in a novelty jar and, when it's strong enough, bring
it to Ravinder and type 'give <pixy> Ravinder'.
~
   Apprentice Ravinder tosses the purple and brown jar in the air and catches
it with a childlike grin. He's almost hugging it as he says, 'You cannot fathom
how much I look forward to the sweet taste of victory with this little guy.
Honestly. Take your reward. Oh, this pixy will be worth so much more. Just,
truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. I'll get started in tomorrow's
race.'

Skycleave: Championship Tour~
   You scrutinize the time-traveler's list of villains, looking for more clues.
It seems the mysterious author has fought all these people somewhere in the
Tower Skycleave and now you find yourself eager to duplicate the feat.
   With this checklist in hand, find and defeat every one of the Tower
Skycleave's combatants. Be warned: like the time-traveler himself, it will take
more than one trip through the tower to get them all. Be sure you're the one to
kill them as well. If they die through some other misfortune, it doesn't count.
~
   You sit on the edge of the fountain and reflect on your battles against the
tower's many villains as you watch the countless twinkling lights from the
tree overhead reflect off of the softly burbling water. Surely this was the
tower's most difficult challenge.

Skycleave: Time-Traveler's Tour~
   You read both sides of the diary page several times, wondering to yourself
where some of these so-called hidden areas might be. At least now the
mysterious time-traveler has provided you a checklist.
   Visit each of the locations in the diary and then return to the first floor
fountain in the Tower Skycleave to complete the quest. Some of these locations
must be visited AFTER the tower has been rescued to count.
~
   You stroll around the fountain several times, watching the reflection of
the enormous tree above you meander around the room in the surface of the
fountain. The tower held so many secrets, a person could spend a lifetime
plumbing its depths.

Skycleave: Out of Time~
   You read the diary page several times and turn it over in your hands. It
clearly wasn't written by the hand of any of these sorcerers. Further, it's
obviously someone who is keenly aware that the Tower Skycleave is stuck in a
time loop -- a fact that seems lost on most of the tower's denizens.
   This merits some investigation. Find the mysterious time-traveler who wrote
the diary and see what insight he has to offer. Afterwards, visit the first
floor fountain to complete the quest.
~
   In the end, it seems the time-traveler met a grim fate. You lay on your back
and think on it, imagining for a moment that you are at the top, not bottom of
this enormous chamber, looking down at the nocturnium tree and the tremendous
fall to its base. This must be how it felt to be trapped in the time loop,
staring into the pit you can never escape from. At least the sorcerers are, on
the whole, unaware of their dark fate.

Skycleave: Test of Water~
   As you once again find yourself underwater and all but trapped by the
magical boundaries of the elemental plane. Sure, escape is just above you,
through the portal back to the fountain. But you were never one to shy away
from a challenge like this.
   Defeat the First Water again, if you can. And be quick about it; it may be
impossible to defeat it for good, but it's known to drown anyone who tries.
Even a brief victory against the First Water would be worthy of celebration.
Defeat it, then speak to the Oreonic in the Attunement Lab.
~
   'Ah, little human, a pleasure to see you again. You are looking particularly
acceptable today,' Goef says as you enter, still dripping from your encounter
with the First Water.
   Goef taps one of its spindly upper arms at your head, lightly, making a
resonant pinging noise as it hits you. The ping echoes off of something in the
room, though you don't see what; it is beyond cluttered in here. Goef seems to
be listening to the sound as it bounces back, though he doesn't necessarily
seem to have ears.
   'I have added your worthiness... to my own,' Goef says at last. 'I have been
unable to defeat the First Water, you see. Once, we were locked in combat for a
week, but even as I could not drown, I also could not... prevail. Next time,
however, I will try it... your way.'
   You stare blankly at the bulky stone creature for a moment before he adds:
   'Not in this body, of course. From time to time, I loose myself from it and
travel the aether... alone.'

Skycleave: Secret Niamh~
   Amongst the Skycleave variations, there is a hidden thread in the time loop
in which the Shadow Hide herself, Niamh, rises to the rank of High Sorcerer.
Seek out this twist of fate and learn Niamh's own thoughts on her place in the
time loop.
   Finding Acting High Sorcerer Niamh will require patience. Return to the
tower some time after saving it to see if she has received this rare promotion.
~
   Acting High Sorcerer Niamh stops what she's doing and listens dismissively,
at first, as you tell her about the time loop and its variations. But her
interest grows as you provide more and more details...
   'You're saying Grand High Sorcerer Knezz might have lived?' she asks, and
you nod. She ponders it for a moment.
   'My word,' she says at last. 'I shall set myself to researching this odd
phenomenon at once. Perhaps my new station in the Tower will prove useful in
getting answers.'
   You try to discuss it further, but Niamh seems lost in her own thoughts and
she soon wanders off.

Skycleave: Elemental Plane of Water~
   You struggle for a breath as you realize you fell too far into the fountain.
All you can see in every direction is water -- and it seems to be alive! The
situation is as interesting as it is unexpected, and you vow to investigate it
once you've defeated the living water.
   After you defeat the living embodiment of the First Water, seek out someone
in the Tower Skycleave who has more information.
~
   'Oh bother,' Annelise says as you interrupt her mending an old iron staff.
She tosses it into the rubbish pile and ties her hair up out of her face. She
takes a seat and wipes sweat from her forehead.
   'I didn't even realize we had an appointment,' she says. She glances across
the desk at her calendar, then back to you, then back to the calendar.
   You interrupt and tell her about your fight with the First Water, from which
you still don't feel like you've completely dried off. You tell her about the
pressure in your lungs, about feeling like you were about to drown when the
living water finally died. And, of course, you mention that it came right back
to life afterward.
   'I do keep telling the headmaster we should lock that portal,' Annelise says
when you finish the tale. 'It's an actual elemental plane, if you can believe
it. Frankly you're lucky to have made it out. We lost a lot of pages before we
put up a sign... which seems to have gone missing.
   'Anyway, you can't actually kill it. It's Water itself. All water. Every-
where. But it's a great test of an adventurer's mettle. Be sure to fight it
again when you get the chance.'

Gobbrabakh of Orka: Where Am I?~
   As you step onto the rooftop, it begins to dawn on you that you are NOT
where you were before -- or where you expected to be. 'What is this place?
And where am I?' you wonder aloud as you look out over the city.
   The hot summer sun beats down on you as you try to get your bearings. Were
you just in a tower somewhere? As you struggle to find the answer in your own
memory, you're quickly distracted by someone walking by. You start to wonder if
anyone is going to believe you about this place...
   Find something tangible to take back to the tower. Perhaps you can find a
sorcerer there who will be interested in it.
~
   Tyrone makes a puzzles face as he takes the jade tear from you and turns it
over and over between his fingers.
   'I have one exactly like this in my room,' he says. 'I mean, ex-act-lee. I
wonder if it even... well...'
   He holds the tear up to the light, rubs it between his palms, even sniffs at
it as he marvels.
   'I need to compare it's, er, properties. To the other one. Thanks!'

Gobbrabakh of Orka: Bloodletting Ritual~
   Celles bids you sit for a moment and you take a spot on one of the mats. She
carefully leans herself onto a small stool and breathes hard out her nose as
she lets herself relax.
   'These old bones don't move like they used to,' she says. 'Thank you for
taking a moment to speak with me. Today is an important day for the Gobbrabakh
of Orka. On this day, we celebrate with food and stories and, most importantly,
bloodletting in the arena.'
   The old goblin pauses for a moment and shifts her weight on the stool.
   'It would be a great honor for us if you would participate. It's quite rare
to have an outsider here during the holy days. Please, do us this honor. Face
our champion in the arena.'
~
   As the dust settles on the arena and the champion, Biksi, collects herself
in the shade, the crowd stands in awe. The sun crests the sky overhead and
slowly, a chant builds among the spectators, louder and louder, until it grows
into a cheer. You can't make out what they're saying -- or you can't understand
it -- but they seem thrilled at your performance in the arena.

   As you drift off to sleep, you find yourself sitting by a muddy river with
your trusty fishing net hanging nearby. You've been here before. Or, at least,
you think you have.
   When you get back to the Tower Skycleave, perhaps you can find someone who
wants to hear about your dream. In the meantime, try some fishing.
~
   'I've had that exact dream,' Sanjiv says as you recall the story of the
endless fishing river.
   'Which is just awful,' he adds. 'Imagine doing work in your dream. As if
things weren't stressful enough here already. I almost got merc'd by that
stylish archmage just trying... just trying to do my job.'

Skycleave: House of God~
   Just as sleep overtakes you, a bright light grows behind your eyelids and
a feeling of warmth and comfort envelops you like a blanket. A sense of small-
ness settles in as you find yourself in an audience with a being far, far
greater than yourself.
   It's a cozy dream; the kind you'll yearn for when you finally wake up. And
perhaps it will be of interest to someone next time you're in the Tower
Skycleave.
~
   There's a creaking noise as Goef turns its head toward you and raises its
heavy brow.
   'A curious thing,' it says slowly. 'My... people... have neither dreams nor
gods. After all, we were created by the wizards of Man -- a creator neither
safe to worship, nor ever worthy of it. I would surely like to meet a god some
day. Perhaps it would give us something Mankind could not.'
