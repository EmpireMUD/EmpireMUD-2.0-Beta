Winter Wonderland: Cookie Crunch Time~
   Santa's elves have completely run out of Christmas cookies! They offer you a
gift from the few spare gifts that are left un-wrapped, if you can bake them a
few more.
(If you don't have the recipe for Christmas cookies, try opening more gifts.)
~
   You leave the cookies, festively packaged on the table for the elves to come
collect. By time you've turned around, the cookies are gone and a left-over
gift has replaced them.

Hey Diddle Diddle~
   Hey diddle diddle, it seems the cat has lost its fiddle. Find the fiddle and
return it to the musical cat in exchange for a starry cloak.
   You can 'use' the fiddle to teleport back to the nearest Mother Goose
adventure. From there, try 'where musical' to find the cat.
~
   You give the cat his fiddle. He seems so grateful that he immediately plays
you a little tune:
 Hey diddle diddle,
 The cat and the fiddle,
 The cow jumped over the moon.
 The little dog laughed,
 To see such sport,
 And the dish ran away with the spoon.
