Hey Diddle Diddle~
   Hey diddle diddle, it seems the cat has lost its fiddle. Find the fiddle and
return it to the cat in exchange for a starry cloak.
~
   You give the cat his fiddle. He seems so grateful that he immediately plays
you a little tune:
 Hey diddle diddle,
 The cat and the fiddle,
 The cow jumped over the moon.
 The little dog laughed,
 To see such sport,
 And the dish ran away with the spoon.

To fetch a pail of water.

And Jill came tumbling after.

Jack Be Nimble (unlit candlestick)~
   Jack is a real daredevil, but there's nothing to jump around here but the
creek. If you could bring Jack his candlestick, perhaps he'd share his best
jumping shoes.
~
   You hand Jack his candlestick, which he lights and proceeds to jump over.
He looks no worse for the wear, other than his singed shoes. He chants a little
rhyme as he jumps:
Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick,
Jack jump over
The candlestick.

Jack Sprat Could Eat No Fat~
   Jack Sprat is looking for the fatty ham which he was to share with his wife.
Jack is all skin and bones, and looks like he needs the ham more than you do.
Perhaps if you return it to him, he'll give you his old belt.
~
You give Jack the fatty ham, and he sings you a little tune:
Jack Spart could eat no fat.
His wife could eat no lean.
And so between them both, you see,
They licked the platter clean.

Little Jack Horner Sat In The Corner~

Little Jack Horner
Sat in the corner,
Eating a Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb,
And pulled out a plum,
And said 'What a good boy am I!'

Eating Her Curds And Whey~
   Little Miss Muffet has lost her curds and whey. If you could find her lunch,
she would happily give you a nice earring in exchange.
~
   Miss Muffet quickly snatches the meal and sits down to eat, while a voice
nearby sings:
Little Miss Muffet
Sat on a tuffet,
Eating her curds and whey;
Along came a spider
Who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

Its Fleece Was White As Snow~

lamb. Return it to her in exchange for a warm reward.

His fleece was white as snow,
And everwhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.

Some Broth Without Any Bread~
   The old woman in the giant shoe has lost the only thing she had to feed her
children: her broth. If you could find it and return it to her, she might be
able to spare a shoelace as reward.
~
You give the soup to the old woman, who sings as she ladles:
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.
She had so many children, she didn't know what to do;
So she gave them some broth without any bread;
And she whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed.
