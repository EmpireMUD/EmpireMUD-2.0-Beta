Join the Guild of Adventurers~
   If you want to join the Guild of Adventurers, you must first demonstrate
commitment by commissioning a guildhall in one of your cities. You receive a
guild charter; take it home and 'build guildhall <direction>' to set it up.
Once the new guildhall is complete and guild officials have moved in, speak to
the Superintendant in your guildhall.
~
   You have demonstrated your eagerness to join the Guild of Adventurers by
building a guildhall. The Superintendant grants you membership and you may now
take on guild quests. Look around the guildhall for tasks you can perform to
ingratiate yourself with the guild.

Here to Sign Up~
   The superintendant looks up at you, stands up from his desk, and claps you
on the shoulders with both hands. 'Here to sign up? ' he asks, jovially. 'All
members of the empire are welcome here, whether you're a ratcatcher or a...
Dragoncatcher, I suppose!'
~
You sign your name to the guild roster.

My Very Own Egg~
   You have acquired an atlasian egg -- a truly rare treasure indeed! You can
feel the embryonic tortoise's heartbeat within the shell. You need to find some
clear desert or plains and 'plant' the egg to help it grow and hatch.
~
The egg is settled into its nest... but it still needs care in order to hatch.

Tending the Egg~
   The egg doesn't seem to be warm enough. You're no expert on the care and
rearing of atlasian tortoises, but it doesn't seem like any ordinary covering
is going to help. Fortunately, you've heard of a salve made from burnt zephyr
cattails. If only you could find some...
~
   You spread the burnt zephyr salve on the egg, and can hear a soft cooing
sound coming from inside. The egg twitches a little... It seems happy, but
there's more work to do before it can hatch.

Bonfire of the Tortoises~
   Now that the egg has begun to grow, you realize zephyr salve alone won't be
enough to hatch it. You recall hearing someone at the Tipsy Tortoise Tavern
recall the story of hatching a giant egg. And as you recall, he did it by
building a huge fire from magewood, and lighting it with powerful magical
artifacts. You jot down a quick list: magewood, wild fire, violet gems,
skystones, and the essence of a molten fiend.
~
   You stack the magewood, sprinkle it with skystones and violet gems, and
light the whole thing ablaze with wild fire and molten essence! Now to wait for
it to hatch...

The Grove: Capture a Wildling~
   The Guild of Adventurers needs more information on the Magiterranean. Find a
portal into The Grove somewhere in the forest, make your way inside, and find a
wildling. Be warned! The wildlings like to spring out from the forest without
warning. Take this trusty net and type 'net wildling' once you find one. Bring
the captured wildling back here for further study.
~
   You drop the net with your captured wildling. You can now perform daily
quests in The Grove for the Guild of Adventurers.

Monsoon Rift: Investigate the Rift~
   The Magiterranean is a dangerous place, but many adventurers get their start
exploring its strange wilderness. The Guild needs more information about the
rifts in the desert. Seek one out -- be careful of the cacti guarding it -- and
venture inside. Speak to the head druid to learn more about the rifts. But
whatever he tells you, you must also find a way to collapse the rift. Return
when you've accomplished this. (Type 'speak' when you find the druid.)
~
   The guild is satisfied that you closed the rift, and takes the druid's
propaganda for further study. You can now perform daily quests in the Monsoon
Rift for the Guild of Adventurers.

Goblin Outpost: Pay Off Dryleef~
   From time to time, you may find goblins setting up shop in your cities'
sewers. Find a goblin outpost somewhere in your sewers, and pay off the
goblins' leader, Dryleef, to ensure the goblins don't cause any trouble. Of
course, you can't be seen bribing the goblins, so just ask Dryleef if you can
buy a ticket to the "Goblin Gala". Type 'buy ticket' when you find Dryleef.
~
   You hand over your ticket to the Goblin Gala, but the guild leader just
laughs. 'At least now we shouldn't have to worry about the goblins stealing
from the city,' he says.

Permafrost: Cold Cold Cuts~
   The Guild of Adventurers has heard of icy winds coming from strange portals
around the river. Rumor has it that these portals lead into the Permafrost, a
particularly inhospitable corner of the Magiterranean. Seek out such a portal
and head into the Permafrost, and see what awaits you there. If you can,
butcher some of the wildlife and help us prepare a plate of cold cuts for
Nostrazak. (If you don't have Butcher, try bringing the Permafrost animal
corpses to a player who does.)
~
   Ah, these cold cuts are perfect. And it seems you have survived the
Permafrost. You can now perform Guild daily quests in the Permafrost.

Thieves: Locate the Hideout~
   The Guild has heard that some thieves have taken up residence in some old
ruins. Thieves are not necessarily enemies of the Guild of Adventurers, but it
is still a good idea to keep tabs on them. Locate the correct ruins and find
the thieves' den inside, and report back to the Guild.
~
   Your report on the thieves and their hideout in the ruins has helped the
Guild, and you can now perform daily quests in that adventure.

Ratskins: A Totem of our Friendship~
   A former member of the Guild of Adventurers has moved into the sewers. They
call him Ratskins, and you can probably guess why. He's no longer with the
guild, but Nostrazak wants to keep a line of communication open with him. Kill
15 sewer rats and take their skins to Ratskins, and type 'trade'. He will give
you a small totem made from some of those skins as a reward. Return with the
totem so that we can analyze its mana source.
~
   You hand over the ratskin totem. You can now perform daily quests for the
Guild of Adventurers in Ratskins's sewer.

substance called 'wild fire'. Unfortunately, we've run out of samples to work
with. Travel into the Magiterranean's mysterious Grove, and return with some of
the wild fire.
~
You hand over the wild fire.

invaders at their stems.

Venture into the rift and find a good way to close it. You'll receive a share
of what the Guild is paid for this service.

tavern patrons haven't been able to get enough of it. In fact, the Guild has
run out of pies again. Collect some rhubarb and back four pies for the guild.
If you don't have any rhubarb fields, try foraging outside one of the portals.
~
   Four rhubarb pies! The tavernkeep will be elated. Here's your share of the
proceeds.

dangerously low on frost. It would be hazardous to try to steal frost from the
Polar Baron himself, but his apprentices are easier targets. Venture into the
Permafrost and 'use siphon <target>' on his Cryomancer and his Rime Mage, then
return the siphoned frost power to the guild.
~
You hand over the siphon and the frosty power it contains.

Thieves: Dues Unpaid~
   The Adventurers have a somewhat strained relationship with the thieves
guild. They do a job for us, we pay them. We do a job for them, they pay us.
Except sometimes they forget that last part, and now we must send a clear
message about what happens when they decide to steal from us instead. Track
down a group of thieves and make sure they get the message.
~
It's messy work, but the Guild thanks you for doing it.

Thieves: Lighten the Load~
   The Guild of Adventurers does, from time to time, employ thieves to help
acquire particularly rare items, especially from dragons. However, this comes
at a price, and we have fallen behind on payment. If you could, pickpocket a
bauble from a city sorcerer and deliver it to the thieves; this is our price.
To aid you in this, we have placed an enchantment on you to prevent the
sorcerer from noticing you lift the bauble from his pocket.
~
You set the bauble down on the ground and slowly back away...

   Rats from the sewers have been causing trouble around the guildhall. It's
time for a little good old-fashioned population control. Head into the nearest
sewer and deal with the vermin problem at its root.
~
   That won't be the last we hear -- or smell -- of the rats. But it should be
enough to keep them out of the guildhall.

Ratskins: Cleaning Up the City~
   The sewers have become a problem -- not only are they filled with rats, but
they have attracted all manner of unsavory creatures that chase after those
rats. Explore the nearest sewer. Kill a handful of sewer rats, and be on the
lookout for whoever -- or whatever -- is hunting the rats, and exterminate
those too.
~
   This certainly won't be our last infestation but at least, for now, it's
under control.

craft their tiny goblin armor. Unfortunately, we're out of hides at the moment
and we have a shipment due. Find 5 large skins and take them to Wargreyn in the
nearest Goblin Outpost.

reinforce their position. Unfortunately, we're running short on spare gems and
the shaman, Pimmin, needs some. The best place to get the glowing seashell gems
is by fishing, but goblins are notoriously afraid of water and terrible at
catching fish. See if you can get her five of the seashells by the end of the
day.
~
The shaman says, 'Pimmin hopes you didn't get too wet finding seashells.'
