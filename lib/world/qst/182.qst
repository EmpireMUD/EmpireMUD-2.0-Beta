Join the Guild of Adventurers~
   If you want to join the Guild of Adventurers, you must first demonstrate
commitment by commissioning a guildhall in one of your cities. You receive a
guild charter; take it home and 'build guildhall <direction>' to set it up.
Once the new guildhall is complete and guild officials have moved in, speak to
the Superintendant in your guildhall.
~
   You have demonstrated your eagerness to join the Guild of Adventurers by
building a guildhall. The Superintendant grants you membership and you may now
take on guild quests. Look around the guildhall for tasks you can perform to
ingratiate yourself with the guild.

The Grove: Capture a Wildling~
   The Guild of Adventurers needs more information on the Magiterranean. Find a
portal into The Grove somewhere in the forest, make your way inside, and find a
wildling. Be warned! The wildlings like to spring out from the forest without
warning. Take this trusty net and type 'net wildling' once you find one. Bring
the captured wildling back here for further study.
~
   You drop the net with your captured wildling. You can now perform daily
quests in The Grove for the Guild of Adventurers.

Monsoon Rift: Investigate the Rift~
   The Magiterranean is a dangerous place, but many adventurers get their start
exploring its strange wilderness. The Guild needs more information about the
rifts in the desert. Seek one out -- be careful of the cacti guarding it -- and
venture inside. Speak to the head druid to learn more about the rifts. But
whatever he tells you, you must also find a way to collapse the rift. Return
when you've accomplished this. (Type 'speak' when you find the druid.)
~
   The guild is satisfied that you closed the rift, and takes the druid's
propaganda for further study. You can now perform daily quests in the Monsoon
Rift for the Guild of Adventurers.

Goblin Outpost: Pay Off Dryleef~
   From time to time, you may find goblins setting up shop in your cities'
sewers. Find a goblin outpost somewhere in your sewers, and pay off the
goblins' leader, Dryleef, to ensure the goblins don't cause any trouble. Of
course, you can't be seen bribing the goblins, so just ask Dryleef if you can
buy a ticket to the "Goblin Gala". Type 'buy ticket' when you find Dryleef.
~
   You hand over your ticket to the Goblin Gala, but the guild leader just
laughs. 'At least now we shouldn't have to worry about the goblins stealing
from the city,' he says.

Permafrost: Cold Cold Cuts~
   The Guild of Adventurers has heard of icy winds coming from strange portals
around the river. Rumor has it that these portals lead into the Permafrost, a
particularly inhospitable corner of the Magiterranean. Seek out such a portal
and head into the Permafrost, and see what awaits you there. If you can,
butcher some of the wildlife and help us prepare a plate of cold cuts for
Nostrazak. (If you don't have Butcher, try bringing the Permafrost animal
corpses to a player who does.)
~
   Ah, these cold cuts are perfect. And it seems you have survived the
Permafrost. You can now perform Guild daily quests in the Permafrost.

Thieves: Locate the Hideout~
   The Guild has heard that some thieves have taken up residence in some old
ruins. Thieves are not necessarily enemies of the Guild of Adventurers, but it
is still a good idea to keep tabs on them. Locate the correct ruins and find
the thieves' den inside, and report back to the Guild.
~
   Your report on the thieves and their hideout in the ruins has helped the
Guild, and you can now perform daily quests in that adventure.

Ratskins: A Totem of our Friendship~
   A former member of the Guild of Adventurers has moved into the sewers. They
call him Ratskins, and you can probably guess why. He's no longer with the
guild, but Nostrazak wants to keep a line of communication open with him. Kill
15 sewer rats and take their skins to Ratskins, and type 'trade'. He will give
you a small totem made from some of those skins as a reward. Return with the
totem so that we can analyze its mana source.
~
   You hand over the ratskin totem. You can now perform daily quests for the
Guild of Adventurers in Ratskins's sewer.
