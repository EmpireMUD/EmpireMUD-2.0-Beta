Join the Guild of Adventurers~
   If you want to join the Guild of Adventurers, you must first demonstrate
commitment by commissioning a guildhall in one of your cities. You receive a
guild charter; take it home and 'build guildhall <direction>' to set it up.
Once the new guildhall is complete and guild officials have moved in, speak to
the Superintendant in your guildhall.
~
   You have demonstrated your eagerness to join the Guild of Adventurers by
building a guildhall. The Superintendant grants you membership and you may now
take on guild quests. Look around the guildhall for tasks you can perform to
ingratiate yourself with the guild.

Here to Sign Up~
   The superintendant looks up at you, stands up from his desk, and claps you
on the shoulders with both hands. 'Here to sign up? ' he asks, jovially. 'All
members of the empire are welcome here, whether you're a ratcatcher or a...
Dragoncatcher, I suppose!'
~
You sign your name to the guild roster.

Seek Out Fame and Adventure~
   The barkeep takes you aside and leans over to say, 'You have the look of an
adventurer about you. Perhaps you've heard of the Guild of Adventurers. They
always need fresh blood. Here, take this seeker stone and use it to find the
atlasian tortoise that the guild calls their home.'
   You can use 'seek guild' to find directions to the nearest atlasian
tortoise. Once you reach the tortoise, board it and enter the tavern, and
speak with the giant dwarf who works as a bouncer upstairs.
~
You've found your way to the Guild of Adventurers!

My Very Own Egg~
   You have acquired an atlasian egg -- a truly rare treasure indeed! You can
feel the embryonic tortoise's heartbeat within the shell. You need to find some
clear desert or plains and 'plant' the egg to help it grow and hatch.
~
The egg is settled into its nest... but it still needs care in order to hatch.

Tending the Egg~
   The egg doesn't seem to be warm enough. You're no expert on the care and
rearing of atlasian tortoises, but it doesn't seem like any ordinary covering
is going to help. Fortunately, you've heard of a salve made from burnt zephyr
cattails. If only you could find some...
~
   You spread the burnt zephyr salve on the egg, and can hear a soft cooing
sound coming from inside. The egg twitches a little... It seems happy, but
there's more work to do before it can hatch.

Bonfire of the Tortoises~
   Now that the egg has begun to grow, you realize zephyr salve alone won't be
enough to hatch it. You recall hearing someone at the Tipsy Tortoise Tavern
recall the story of hatching a giant egg. And as you recall, he did it by
building a huge fire from magewood, and lighting it with powerful magical
artifacts. You jot down a quick list: magewood, wild fire, violet gems,
skystones, and the essence of a molten fiend.
~
   You stack the magewood, sprinkle it with skystones and violet gems, and
light the whole thing ablaze with wild fire and molten essence! Now to wait for
it to hatch...

The Grove: Capture a Wildling~
   The Guild of Adventurers needs more information on the Magiterranean. Find a
portal into The Grove somewhere in the forest, make your way inside, and find a
wildling. Be warned! The wildlings like to spring out from the forest without
warning. Take this trusty net and type 'net wildling' once you find one. Bring
the captured wildling back here for further study.
~
   You drop the net with your captured wildling. You can now perform daily
quests in The Grove for the Guild of Adventurers.

Monsoon Rift: Investigate the Rift~
   The Magiterranean is a dangerous place, but many adventurers get their start
exploring its strange wilderness. The Guild needs more information about the
rifts in the desert. Seek one out -- be careful of the cacti guarding it -- and
venture inside. Speak to the head druid to learn more about the rifts. But
whatever he tells you, you must also find a way to collapse the rift. Return
when you've accomplished this. (Type 'speak' when you find the druid.)
~
   The guild is satisfied that you closed the rift, and takes the druid's
propaganda for further study. You can now perform daily quests in the Monsoon
Rift for the Guild of Adventurers.

Goblin Outpost: Pay Off Dryleef~
   From time to time, you may find goblins setting up shop in your cities'
sewers. Find a goblin outpost somewhere in your sewers, and pay off the
goblins' leader, Dryleef, to ensure the goblins don't cause any trouble. Of
course, you can't be seen bribing the goblins, so just ask Dryleef if you can
buy a ticket to the "Goblin Gala". Type 'buy ticket' when you find Dryleef.
~
   You hand over your ticket to the Goblin Gala, but the guild leader just
laughs. 'At least now we shouldn't have to worry about the goblins stealing
from the city,' he says.

Permafrost: Cold Cold Cuts~
   The Guild of Adventurers has heard of icy winds coming from strange portals
around the river. Rumor has it that these portals lead into the Permafrost, a
particularly inhospitable corner of the Magiterranean. Seek out such a portal
and head into the Permafrost, and see what awaits you there. If you can,
butcher some of the wildlife and help us prepare a plate of cold cuts for
Nostrazak. (If you don't have Butcher, try bringing the Permafrost animal
corpses to a player who does.)
~
   Ah, these cold cuts are perfect. And it seems you have survived the
Permafrost. You can now perform Guild daily quests in the Permafrost.

ruins. Thieves are not necessarily enemies of the Guild of Adventurers, but it
is still a good idea to keep tabs on them. Locate the correct ruins and find
the thieves' den inside, and report back to the Guild.
~
   Your report on the thieves and their hideout in the ruins has helped the
Guild, and you can now perform daily quests in that adventure.

Ratskins: A Totem of our Friendship~
   A former member of the Guild of Adventurers has moved into the sewers. They
call him Ratskins, and you can probably guess why. He's no longer with the
guild, but Nostrazak wants to keep a line of communication open with him. Kill
15 sewer rats and take their skins to Ratskins, and type 'trade'. He will give
you a small totem made from some of those skins as a reward. Return with the
totem so that we can analyze its mana source.
~
   You hand over the ratskin totem. You can now perform daily quests for the
Guild of Adventurers in Ratskins's sewer.

the wild fire.
~

Permafrost and 'use siphon <target>' on his Cryomancer and his Rime Mage, then
return the siphoned frost power to the guild.

guild. They do a job for us, we pay them. We do a job for them, they pay us.
Except sometimes they forget that last part, and now we must send a clear
message about what happens when they decide to steal from us instead. Track
down a group of thieves and make sure they get the message.
~
It's messy work, but the Guild thanks you for doing it.

Thieves: Lighten the Load~
   The Guild of Adventurers does, from time to time, employ thieves to help
acquire particularly rare items, especially from dragons. However, this comes
at a price, and we have fallen behind on payment. If you could, pickpocket a
bauble from a city sorcerer and deliver it to the thieves; this is our price.
To aid you in this, we have placed an enchantment on you to prevent the
sorcerer from noticing you lift the bauble from his pocket.
~
You set the bauble down on the ground and slowly back away...

they have attracted all manner of unsavory creatures that chase after those
rats. Explore the nearest sewer. Kill a handful of sewer rats, and be on the
lookout for whoever -- or whatever -- is hunting the rats, and exterminate
those too.
~
   This certainly won't be our last infestation but at least, for now, it's
under control.

day.

Discuss Support With Your Superintendant~
   Nostrazak pulls out a chair, turns it around, and sits backwards in it to
talk to you -- a necessity for him, as his draconian tail no longer allows him
to sit properly in a chair. Nostrazak explains that the Guild relies on its
many allies throughout the world, and each local guildhall must ingratiate
itself to those allies to ensure their support. He instructs you to return to
your guildhall and make preparations to seek support from the High Lich
Scaldorran, Hedge Witch Germione, Archsorcerer Malfernes, and the mysterious
Adventurer 13.

about finding these allies of the guild. Surely they will be able to help you.
Return here when you have assurances of support from all four key allies:
Scaldorran, Malfernes, Germione, and Adventurer 13.'
~
   You now have enough support for your guildhall from amongst the guild's
allies. You can complete daily quests from your guildhall to reach the
Venerated reputation level.

Seek Support From Malfernes~
   The guild has many sorcerer allies, but the strongest is Archsorcerer
Malfernes. However, Malfernes has been missing for some time -- millions of
years, in fact. Last time anybody saw Malfernes, he was stuck in a tem-portal
causality loop in the Primeval era. Locate a portal to that era and seek out
the Archsorcerer inside.
   You receive a sorcerous signalling stone. Once you enter the portal,
'use' the stone to signal your guild membership to Malfernes. Otherwise,
he may attack you. You will find him at the end of the primeval forest.
If you have trouble getting there, try bringing a tracker.
~
Archsorcerer Malfernes agrees to support you, in exchange for some help.

Fetch the Cursed Chalice of Mill Manor~
   Archsorcerer Malfernes has long coveted powerful artifacts, but he has been
unable to expand his collection while he's stuck in this time loop, deep in the
distant past. You could win his support by traveling to Mill Manor, deep in the
swamp, and solve the clues there to find the cursed chalice. Malfernes gives
you a countercurse talisman. Once you have the chalice, 'use' the talisman to
negate the curse so you can return the chalice to Malfernes in the Primeval.
~
   You have completed the quest. Malfernes takes the chalice from you and
conjures a stream of wine from the air, filling the chalice. He takes a drink
and then coughs, spurting wine into your face. He then tucks the chalice into
his sleeve and makes a thoughtful face. He seems to have forgotten you're here.

Imagine Dragons~
   Archsorcerer Malfernes confides in you that he has a long-standing rivalry
with High Sorceress Celiya after an incident involving a mutual former lover, a
poorly-trained skeletal mammoth, and sixty-thousand barrels of manawine. But
being trapped in the Primeval era, Malfernes is unable to continue this war of
practical jokes. He hands you the Staff of Draconic Imagination and instructs
you to seek out a flame dragon or a wandering dragon who has abandoned its
nest, and 'use staff' to capture its image. Then head to the Tower Skycleave
and 'use staff' again to release the image in the tower.
~
   Malfernes cackles with glee when you tell him about your escapades at the
Tower Skycleave.

Seek Support From Germione~
   Even when an adventurer retires, their affiliation with the guild continues.
You must seek out one such former member, the hedge witch Germione, who lives in a
hut on stilts in the swamp. Find the hut, pull down the rope ladder, and pay
Germione a visit. Perhaps her support will be enough to secure your guildhall.
   Say the word 'friend' so Germione knows you come in peace.
~
   The hedge witch, Germione, agrees to support you in exchange for some
'errands'.

Germione's Ratcatcher~
   'The secret to training swamp rats is, they can't be trained,' Germione
says. 'I have to import city rats and then hex them into swamp rats. You just
can't train the real swamp rats like you can the city rats.'
   Germione gives you a ratcatcher's net. Find an open sewer in one of your
cities and 'net rat' to capture some rats in the sewer. You'll need 10 of them.
~
Germione squeals with joy to see you've brought back 10 rats.

Vengeance for Measley~
   Germione leans forward and wipes a tear from her eye with a grotesque
ratskin handkerchief as she tells you the story of her favorite pet, Measley.
As a rust-colored rat, Measely was perfect for spying on Germione's enemies
across the realm. Perfect, that is, until poor, defenseless Measley was eaten
by the Sun King's pet snake, Bitesaratl. Find the Lost Temple and defeat the
Sun King to avenge precious Measely. Then, leave the temple and wait a few
minutes for it to convert into a permanent Jungle Temple, then claim that
temple.
(You must leave the Lost Temple's map location in order for it to become a
Jungle Temple.)
~
   Germione cries and hugs you as you tell her the tale of your quest to avenge
beloved Measley's death.

Seek Support From Scaldorran~
   The guild has an ally working in a mid-level position in the Tower
Skycleave. Like many sorcery towers, Skycleave sometimes teleports around from
place to place. But it always announces its presence, so you may be able to
find it by asking around. Find the High Lich, Scaldorran, in the Lich Labs and
see if you can convince him to rally support behind our guildhall.
   You can let Scaldorran know you're from the guild by using his old codeword,
'Eternity'. Just say that to him when you find him.
~
High Lich Scaldorran seems convinced to let you prove your worth...

Procure a Roc Egg~
   Scaldorran has a deep, eternal hunger that can never be sated by earthly
foods -- such is the fate of all liches. But the abominable Yetsy has recently
shared a recipe for 1000 Year Eggs, and Scaldorran only needs a good Roc egg to
make it work. Seek out the gigantic nest of the Roc and 'use sack' to steal the
egg, then return it to Scaldorran to gain his favor.
Hints:
- Gigantic Nest adventures don't show up on 'nearby'; try 'scan'.
- Make sure you steal the egg with 'use sack', not by doing the egg's quest.
~
   Scaldorran slips the roc egg into his ethereal cloak as strands of ectoplasm
drip from his gaping maw.

   Scaldorran pulls you aside and casts a Cone of Silence around you. 'Between
you and me,' he says, 'the Guild doesn't trust the Grand High Sorcerer. I need
you to take this enchanted bug up to the office, and plant it while nobody is
looking. And be quick about it.'
~
   Scaldorran ends the tips of his bandages together and mutters
'eeeeexcellent' to himself.

Seek Support From Adventurer 13~
   The guild has eyes everywhere, from the courts of emperors, to the bottom of
the canyon. One such pair of eyes belong to a man known only as Adventurer 13.
His true identity is known only to Nostrazak and the other guild leaders, but
he has been seen camping in Burrow Canyons. Find a canyon entrance beneath a
mine and seek him out. He will ask you a single question to test your loyalty;
you must say this answer aloud: River.

Adventurer 13 seems convinced you are who you say.

Fruit of the Serene Canyon~
   Adventurer 13 has grown quite hungry living as a hermit in Burrow Canyons.
But no ordinary food will sate this hunger. You must travel to the serene
canyon hidden beyond the waterfall. Doing so will not be easy. Be prepared to
navigate the rapids to reach the canyon. Once you reach the serene canyon, you
should be able to forage for the rare crops for Adventurer 13. (Hint: 'open
waterfall')
~
Adventurer 13 eagerly takes the serene food you offer him.

Message for the Goblins~
   After a long, strange story, you learn that Adventurer 13 has a
long-standing grudge against Furl, war shaman of the goblins. It seems Furl has
discovered the secret to immortality, allowing him to resurrect after every
defeat. Adventurer 13 wants you to track down Furl, whose goblins are known to
hide out in ruined buildings, and defeat him. When you do, let Furl's
temporarily-rotting corpse know 'The Adventurers send their regards.'
~
   Adventurer 13 cackles with glee at the news that you have delivered his
message to Furl.
