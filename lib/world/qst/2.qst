Brick Tutorial~
   It looks like you've found some clay. There are a lot of things you can make
with clay, but the first one you should learn is the brick. To make a pile of
bricks:
 1. You need the Basic Crafts ability (skill buy Basic Crafts).
    (If you don't have Trade 1, do some other tutorials first.)
 2. You need a fire to harden the clay. If you already have a flint set and an
 axe, chop down a tree and light it on fire.
 3. Type 'craft bricks'.
 Tip: You can make clay items faster by building a potter.
(You can type 'toggle tutorials' to stop seeing new tutorial quests.)
~
   Bricks are a common building material. Try typing 'recipe bricks' to see
what you can make.
