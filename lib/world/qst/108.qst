   Ranger Clara wants you to go out and chop 6 trees, and bring them back.

    handaxe.
 3. Wield the handaxe and then 'craft handle'.

 4. Once you have 6 trees, return to Ranger Clara.
Note: Make sure you don't have Empire noskilled.

Build Storage Buildings~
   Rosemary knows you'll need a place to store resources for your burgeoning
empire. These buildings are easy to build, and you'll need to make several:
 1. A lumberyard to store your trees and lumber.

 3. A foundry to store and smelt ore.
 4. A quarry to get stone blocks.
Return to the City Planner's office when you're done.

Build A Mine~
   Rosemary wants you to scrape a few more trees and then head into the
mountains to build a mine. You'll need mines in order to find ore. It doesn't
matter which mountain tile you build the mine on, but be sure to build it
facing off the mountain and onto flat land. If you learn Mountain Climbing
later, you'll be able to build deeper in the mountain ranges and face your
mines toward other Mountain tiles. Return to Rosemary's office when you're
done.

empire to really work metal. In addition to the iron ingots you already made,
you also need to dig up some rocks and saw some lumber. You can saw the lumber

The Perfect Rock~
   Horation is looking for just the right rock to represent the Stone Age. It
needs to be slightly gray or brown, between the size of a pea and the size of
your fist, and either smooth or rough. Basically, any rock will do. You never
know which one it will be.
   Note: Make sure you don't have Trade noskilled.
~
   Horation looks at the rock you've brought him. He measures it with fine
brass calipers, weighs it on the scale, and even tastes the top of it. But,
this just isn't the right rock, so he tells you to keep it.

Collect Basic Resources~
   Horation explains that he is trying to open a museum to show off the
accomplishments of Early Man that led to the first empires and the dawn of
civilization. The real problem is that nobody will fund an archaeological dig
to get artifacts for the museum. Horation is willing to pay you to craft some
authentic artifacts for his displays.
   Horation would like you to collect a few basic resources:
 1. Collect rocks by digging in plains, forest, or deserts. For this
    quest, you need 7 ordinary rocks.
 2. Collect sticks by gathering in any forest or grove. You need 4.
 3. Return to Horation in the museum.
Note: Make sure you don't have Trade noskilled.
~
Horation looks over each of the rocks and sticks, and seems to approve.

Examples of Smithed Tools~
The curator would like you to forge some metal tools.
Steps:
 1. Type 'skill buy forge'.
 2. You will also need a Forge building. If you haven't already,
    it's a good time to do the Empire tutorial quests at the
    Royal Planning Office. Or, type 'build info forge'.

    hammer from a rock and handle, if you need one.
 4. Use 'forge info' to see what's needed to make a hammer,
    nails, and a pick. You will need to make a metal hammer
    to complete the quest; that stone one isn't good enough
    for Horation.
 5. Collect 4 common metal ingots (copper or iron) and 2
    handles.
 6. Forge the items on the list.
 7. Return to Horation.

Survival: Dig Some Rocks~
   The Spirit of the Wild would like you to dig up a rock and a flint stone.
These basic items will be useful for making tools, and you can dig them up in
most locations on the map. Find a suitable spot, type 'dig', and see what you
can find. When you have a rock and a flint, return to the Spirit of the Wild.
~
   You have satisfied the Spirit of the Wild! Digging and gathering are good

Battle: Slay A Beast~
   The Spirit of the Hunt wants you to practice your Battle skill by killing a
wild animal. Exit the Soulstream and find an animal to hunt. You should pick a
small one like a squirrel or prairie dog, as you might find larger animals to
be too much trouble. Use the 'kill' command to attack the animal; you will
continue to hit it until one of you defeats the other. When you have killed a
small animal, skin it and bring its skin back to the Spirit of the Hunt. You
may have to kill several animals to find a good skin.
   You receive a stone skinning knife for this quest. Look at it to learn
how to use it.

You have satisfied the Spirit of the Hunt!

Natural Magic: Heal The Spirits~
   The Spirit of Mana seems to be fading, and needs you to heal it. Purchase
the healing ability using 'skill buy heal', and then heal the Spirit of Mana
using 'heal mana'. The Heal ability can usually only be used on yourself (until
you learn Heal Friend), but the Spirit of Mana can be healed with the basic
Heal.
~
   You have restored the Spirit of Mana! You can heal yourself after combat to
raise your Natural Magic skill further.

Stealth: Sneaking Silently~
   The Spirit of Darkness will teach you to move unseen. The Sneak ability
allows you to do this, although it isn't a guaranteed success at low levels.
You can't really tell whether or not you were successful at sneaking. But don't
worry, you'll get better at it as you level up.
 1. Purchase the ability with 'skill buy sneak'.
 2. Find the Spirit of Darkness again.
 3. Go to another room in the Soulstream.
 4. Move toward the Spirit of Darkness with 'sneak <direction>'.
    (e.g. 'sneak west')
 5. If you were successful, this quest's tracker will show complete.
 6. Type 'quest track Stealth' to check.
 7. Repeatedly try to sneak up on the Spirit of Darkness until successful.
 8. When you succeed, turn in the quest using 'quest finish Stealth'.
~
You have satisfied the Spirit of Darkness with your stealth.

Empire: Early Harvest~
   The Spirit of Progress wants to teach you to harvest crops, an essential
step in building your empire. Harvesting is a good way to gain Empire skill at
low levels, and will provide you with food or raw materials. You are provided a
stone scythe for this quest, but most sharp weapons can be used to harvest.
 1. Go out onto the map and find a crop tile like a wheat field or
    a patch of vegetables. Orchards won't work for this, since they
    use 'pick' instead of 'harvest'.
 2. Wield your scythe or other sharp weapon.
 3. Type 'harvest'. It will take a minute to finish.
 4. Return to the Spirit of Progress when you've harvested a crop.
~
You have satisfied the Spirit of Progress.

Vampire: Feed On Blood~
   The Spirit of Blood wants you to feed on a living creature to refill your
blood. Leave the Soulstream and find something with a beating heart to feast
from. Knock out your victim in combat ('toggle autokill' will make you stop
combat before killing your victim), then 'bite' them and drain some blood.
When you have done this, return to the Spirit of Blood.
~
   You have satisfied the Spirit of Blood! Drinking the blood of live creatures
is enough to gain Vampire skill up to level 15. After that, buy and use Vampire
abilities to become a sanguine master.

Trade: Craft A Flint Set~
   The Spirit of Innovation would like you to craft a simple flint set, which
can be used to start fires or light torches. Flint sets are handy to carry with
you, because you never know when you'll want to cook food or brew a potion.
 1. Leave the Soulstream by entering the exit portal.
 2. Find a suitable place and type 'dig'.
 3. Dig until you find a rock and a flint stone.
 4. Type 'craft flint set' to combine those items.
 5. Return to the Spirit of Innovation with your flint set.
~
   You have satisfied the Spirit of Innovation! That flint set can be used to
make a torch by typing 'light stick', or to make a cooking fire with 'light
tree'.
