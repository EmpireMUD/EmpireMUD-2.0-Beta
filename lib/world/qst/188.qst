Halloween: Get the Blood Pumping~
A restless spirit appears to tell you:
   Halloween is a vampire's favorite time of year, when ghosts and goblins
abound and every citizen's heart is pounding. To ensure every citizen is at the

blood pumping.
   First 'morph Dracula' then 'scare <citizen>' to complete this quest.

your family. But Grandmother refuses to say if the manor will keep the spirits
out, or if it's the thing that will release them.

   The halloween spirits are bound to the graveyards, and thus can't go around
collecting their own candy. Obviously, you aren't going to want to give up your
own candy. Pickpocket five citizens of your empire for some special treats to
gift to the spirits.
~
The spirits take your freshly stolen candy and grin as they vanish, one by one.

reflections and thank you for the entertainment.

Halloween: Bylda Terror~
   The city is eager to try out a newly discovered folk festival, believed to
be long forgotten because of old taboos against saying the name of a bear. The
Feast of Bylda takes place during the Halloween season, and your kingdom's
subjects are sure to enjoy it.
   Take this set of plans and build a mighty bear in your city from wood and
leather, then enchant it to bring it to life. It'll be a fright to die for.
See 'build info Bylda' for more information on what it will require.
~
   As you finish the magic words, the Bylda comes to life! As it stomps around
the city, you begin to ask yourself: Did I think this plan through all the way?

Halloween: Delegation of Demons~
   A spirit whispers to you: The fabric between your world and the Nether is at
its thinnest during this time of year. You could have an army of demons some
day, and the first step is to get more demons into this world. Suddenly you
notice a note in your pocket with the words to the ritual of demons. You don't
have the power to bind them, but if you had some raw meat, you could use the
ritual of demons to lure some through. Find some, and use 'ritual demons' in
your city to open three portals to the Nether and lure some demons through.
~
Congratulations! You've brought new demons into this world.

Halloween: Songs for the Deaths Yet to Come~
   It's been said that music soothes the soul. Now you can prove it. Take this
haunting sheet music and play it for someone threatening, until they accept the
pacification and leave. Look for someone who would take more than one
adventurer to defeat in combat, otherwise it'll be a waste of your time. Of
course, you also want to be sure you aren't weakening your empire, so the
target can't be a member.

share in the merriment. You need to do this in one of your cities.
~

back for a brief time. Surely their loved ones will be greatful for the chance
to make their peace now.

Halloween: Songs for the Dying~
   The headless centaur is particularly vicious in how he wounds his victims
and then leaves them dying on the ground. In pain and watched by the one who
put them into this condition, adventurers are demoralized. You might not be
able to help with them surviving the battle, but you can at least shield this
latest victim from view and ease the fallen adventurer into the afterlife by
playing some music.
   Build the 'medical tent' at a tomb or cemetery where some poor soul has
tried to fight the headless horse man (any tomb should do), enter the tent, and
then play some music for the poor soul within.
~
   Your music soothes the headless horse man's latest victim as they give up
the ghost. The healers usher you from the medical tent so they can prepare the
body for burial.

Halloween: Ancestor's Offering~
   During Halloween, the spirits of the dead can get closer to the world of the
living than any other time. However, they are only allowed to truly walk in
this world if their portrait is placed on an altar at their tomb. You're
suddenly flooded with memories of your grandmother, who you haven't thought of
in many months. You grab a scrap of old parchment and resolve to invoke her
spirit.
   Head to your grandmother's tomb (or any tomb, really) and type 'invoke
ancestor'. Afterwards, head to your family home (or any home) and type
'paint spirit'. Once you have the portrait of your grandmother, return to the
tomb and type 'place portrait'. That should be enough to summon her.
~
Your grandmother is here once again, if only for a while.
