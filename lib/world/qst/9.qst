Axe Tutorial~
Try crafting an axe to chop down trees. Here are the steps:
 1. Get a handle (find a sapling and follow its tutorial to make one).
 2. Get a handaxe (find a flint and follow its tutorial).
 3. With your handle, type 'craft stone axe'.
(You can type 'toggle tutorials' to stop seeing new tutorial quests.)
~
And now you have an axe.
