plains field grass ground around~
   You stand in the middle of an expansive, flat open plain. The grasses
beneath your feet stretch out in all directions, swaying gently in the breeze.
The occasional bird flits past, calling out to its companions, but otherwise,
there is nothing but a peaceful silence. The openness of the terrain makes you
feel exposed and vulnerable, with nowhere to hide.

A tree shoots up and spreads its canopy wide above you!~
X
forest trees leaves around~
   You find yourself standing at the edge of a light forest. The trees here are
young and slender, and the foliage overhead allows dappled sunlight to filter
through, creating a tranquil, mottled effect on the ground. You can hear the
soft rustling of leaves as a gentle breeze passes through the trees, and the
occasional bird chirping overhead. The forest floor is covered in a soft carpet
of moss and fallen leaves, and the air is cool and refreshing. It's a peaceful
and serene place.

forest trees leaves around~
   You are standing in an overgrown forest, where the underbrush is so thick
that it's difficult to make out the trunks of the massive trees surrounding
you. The air is humid and heavy, and the scent of rich soil and decaying leaves
is almost overwhelming. The forest is alive with the sounds of insects buzzing
and birds calling out to each other. The forest floor is a chaotic jumble of
tangled roots, ferns, and thorns, making movement difficult. It's a wild and
untamed place, where nature reigns supreme.

landscape looks barren and devoid of life, with only scattered rocks and
patches of grass. The stumps are of varying sizes, some freshly cut with sharp

was once teeming with tall trees, but now only the remnants remain.

once stood tall and proud. They now form a jagged line along the water's edge,
their bark stripped and their branches removed. Some stumps are old and
weathered, while others are fresher, with splintered wood still clinging to the
sides. The scent of sawdust and fresh-cut wood hangs in the air, a reminder of
the recent activity.

copse riverside riverbank bank trees forest stumps around~
   As you approach the river, a small copse comes into view, nestled on the
bank. Some of the trees have been felled, leaving stumps of varying heights.
But amidst the stumps, there are signs of new growth: tiny saplings and young
trees are sprouting up, reaching for the light. The lush foliage of the
surrounding forest provides a natural barrier, casting a dappled shade over the
copse. The sound of the nearby river can be heard, its gentle current soothing
and constant.

shore ocean sea water plains around~
   The ocean waves crash against the shore, churning up sand and shells. The
water stretches out endlessly in one direction, while in the other, the shore
meets the plains. Seabirds can be seen swooping and diving into the water,
searching for food. The salty sea air is refreshing and invigorating.

A tree rises rapidly by the shore, quickly shading you with new leaves!~
X
tree shoreside water ocean around~
   A lone tree stands on the edge of the ocean, its roots entwined in the sandy
soil. The constant sea breeze has sculpted its branches, creating a unique
shape that appears to be reaching towards the water. The trunk is rough and
weathered, the bark hardened by years of exposure to the salty air. Despite the
harsh environment, the tree appears healthy, with a crown of green leaves
swaying in the wind.

shore exstuary river water ocean sea around~
   The estuary shore is a mix of mud and sand, with the water slowly rising and
falling with the tide. Small crabs scurry around, digging into the sand and mud
for food. Seagulls and other shorebirds swoop down to grab small fish and other
creatures that have been stranded on the shore by the receding water. In the
distance, the sound of waves crashing against the rocky cliffs can be heard.
The air is salty and fresh, with a slight breeze blowing in from the sea.

foothills hills lake mountain around~
   The foothills rise up gently between the lake and the mountains, forming a
rolling terrain that's scattered with patches of grass and low shrubs. The soil
here is loose and rocky, with occasional outcroppings of weathered stone that
jut out from the hillsides. Small streams trickle down from the higher
elevations, cutting through the soil and rock as they make their way towards
the lake. The foothills are quiet and peaceful, with only the sound of birdsong
and the rustle of leaves to break the stillness.

stumps shore seaside ocean trees forest around~
   You stand on the shore, looking at a row of stumps jutting out of the sand.
It's clear that a forest once stood here, but all that remains now are these
remnants of what was. Some of the stumps are larger, indicating that the trees
were older and more mature when they were cut down. Others are smaller, likely
the result of newer growth that was taken down before it could reach full
height. The area feels barren and desolate, a stark contrast to what it may
have looked like in the past.

copse stumps seaside sea ocean water around forest trees~
   You stand before a seaside copse, the sound of the waves crashing against
the shore nearby. Among the tall trees, you notice several stumps, evidence of
past logging. But there is also a glimmer of hope - small saplings and young
trees are emerging from the stumps, signifying that regrowth has begun. The
salty sea air fills your lungs as you take in the scene, marveling at the
resilience of nature.
