plains field grass ground around~
   You stand in the middle of an expansive, flat open plain. The grasses
beneath your feet stretch out in all directions, swaying gently in the breeze.
The occasional bird flits past, calling out to its companions, but otherwise,
there is nothing but a peaceful silence. The openness of the terrain makes you
feel exposed and vulnerable, with nowhere to hide.

forest trees leaves around~
   You find yourself standing at the edge of a light forest. The trees here are
young and slender, and the foliage overhead allows dappled sunlight to filter
through, creating a tranquil, mottled effect on the ground. You can hear the
soft rustling of leaves as a gentle breeze passes through the trees, and the
occasional bird chirping overhead. The forest floor is covered in a soft carpet
of moss and fallen leaves, and the air is cool and refreshing. It's a peaceful
and serene place.

forest trees leaves around~
   You are standing in an overgrown forest, where the underbrush is so thick
that it's difficult to make out the trunks of the massive trees surrounding
you. The air is humid and heavy, and the scent of rich soil and decaying leaves
is almost overwhelming. The forest is alive with the sounds of insects buzzing
and birds calling out to each other. The forest floor is a chaotic jumble of
tangled roots, ferns, and thorns, making movement difficult. It's a wild and
untamed place, where nature reigns supreme.

world go by for a while.

ocean water horizon around~
   You are surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of open ocean, the horizon
stretching out as far as you can see. The water is a deep blue-green, clear and
inviting. You can feel the salty spray of the sea on your skin and the sound of
waves crashing against each other fills your ears. Seabirds circle overhead,
their calls carried on the wind, and schools of fish dart just beneath the
surface. The ocean is a vast and mysterious place, both beautiful and
intimidating, and the possibilities it holds are limitless.

   You are standing amongst towering mountains, their jagged peaks reaching
towards the sky. The air is cool and crisp, with a hint of pine and other
alpine flora. The mountains are covered in a patchwork of crags and rocky
outcroppings, with streams cascading down their sides. Above, the sky is a
crystal clear, and you can see birds soaring in the distance. The sheer size
and beauty of the mountains is both awe-inspiring and humbling.

emerging from the soil - tiny sprouts, their tender green leaves barely visible
against the brown earth. The air is cool and fresh, with the scent of damp soil

have taken great care to ensure that each seed is planted just so.

delicate shoots reaching up towards the sky. It's too early to tell what kind

place where survival is a constant struggle. As you look around, you can't help

   You have come upon a small clearing, where you can see that the verdant
jungle has been cleared to make way for a new crop. The freshly turned earth is
dark and fertile, and tiny green shoots have just begun to emerge from the
soil. You can't quite make out what the crop is yet, as the plants are still
too small to identify. But you can see that the farmers who planted them have
taken great care to ensure that they are planted in neat rows, with plenty of
space between them to grow. Beyond the clearing, the jungle looms tall and
green, a stark contrast to the orderly rows of the new crop. It's a scene of
life and growth in the midst of a wild and untamed environment, and you can't
help but feel a sense of awe at the tenacity of these farmers in the face of
such daunting surroundings.

trench canal moat ground around~
   You find yourself standing on the edge of a trench that has been
painstakingly dug by hand with a great deal of effort and skill. The walls of
the trench are steep and slick with moisture, and you can hear the distant
sound of water trickling somewhere within. It's evident that this trench was
not dug for mere aesthetics - it has a clear function. Perhaps it was dug to
create a moat or canal, to channel water or to protect a structure. Whatever
its purpose, you can't help but admire the work that went into its creation.
It's a reminder of the industriousness and ingenuity of those who live in this
world, and a testament to what can be accomplished with hard work and
determination.

   You are standing next to a wide, gently flowing canal. The water here is
calm and clear, and you can see the faint ripples caused by the current. The
canal is deep enough that it would be difficult to wade across, and its edges
are lined with tall, sturdy banks of earth. You can see that the canal has been
artificially constructed, as its edges are perfectly straight and symmetrical.
Whether they're being used as a moat to protect a nearby fortress or maybe a
vital waterway for trade and transportation, these canals always fill you with
a sense of awe as impressive feats of human engineering.

desert ground plants cactus cacti around~
   You stand in the midst of a vast, sandy desert, interrupted only by
occasional outcroppings of rock and hardy, low-growing vegetation. The
landscape is rugged and unforgiving, but all around you are signs of life. The
scorching heat beats down on you, and the only sound is the gentle rustling of
the wind as it sweeps across the barren terrain. You feel a sense of isolation
and vulnerability in this harsh, unforgiving landscape.

moister. A small pool of crystal-clear water sparkles in the center of the
verdant grove of plants, inviting you to quench your thirst. The shade provided
by the vegetation offers a welcome respite. You can hear the soothing sound of
a gentle breeze rustling through the leaves.

   A trench has been dug into the desert, its edges rough and uneven. It
stretches out before you, seeming to disappear into the distance. The loose
sand and rocks thrown up alongside the trench suggest that it was recently
excavated, perhaps with the intention of creating an irrigation canal or some
other similar project. Despite the harshness of the desert landscape, the
trench seems to offer a promise of fertility and life.

stumps trees grove around~
   The harsh desert terrain is marred by a series of stumps where a small grove
once stood. The area is now barren, save for a few scattered rocks and the
stumps of the former trees. The heat beats down mercilessly, and the sand is
blown about by the dry desert winds. It's clear that someone has gone to great
effort to cut down the trees, but it's not clear why they would choose to do so
in such a barren place.

desert sand~
   Small dunes of fine, pale sand rise and fall in gentle curves, creating a
rippled landscape that seems to go on forever. Heat shimmers above the sand,
making it hard to see too far ahead. The only relief from the monotonous
scenery are occasional clumps of scraggly, hardy desert plants clinging to life
in the harsh environment.

copse gnarled desert trees grove around~
   You come across a small copse of trees growing in the midst of the arid
desert. Despite the harsh conditions, the trees seem to be thriving, their
roots digging deep into the sandy soil. The trunks are thin, and the branches
are short, but you can see some of them are beginning to produce new leaves.
It's a stark contrast to the desolate surroundings, and the copse provides a
small oasis of greenery in an otherwise barren landscape.

but there is still an abundance of vegetation surrounding you. You can hear the
sound of birds and insects, and the air is thick with humidity. Sunlight
filters through the leaves of the remaining trees, casting dappled patterns on
the ground. You can see small bushes and shrubs growing alongside the path,
their leaves and branches reaching out in all directions. The ground is covered
with a layer of decaying leaves and other organic matter, providing a fertile
bed for the growth of new plants.

rustling of leaves as unseen creatures move through the underbrush.

copse young trees wood forest stumps around~
   As you approach the copse, you see small trees sprouting up from old stumps.
These young saplings are strong and healthy, reaching for the sky with tender,
green shoots. The air around the copse is fresh, filled with the sweet
fragrance of new growth. It's a hopeful sight, a reminder that life goes on and
the forest will thrive again. Birds flit between the trees, their joyful songs
a testament to the beauty of nature's resilience.

edge forest trees around~
   You find yourself standing at the edge of the forest, the last vestige of
civilization before nature takes over. The forest looms before you, the trees
reaching high into the sky, their branches forming a canopy overhead. The
ground is covered in a thick layer of leaves and twigs, and the air is filled
with the sound of chirping birds and rustling leaves. The scent of pine and
earth fills your nostrils, inviting you to explore the vast wilderness that
lies ahead.

clumps of reeds and cattails sprouting up from the water's edge. The air is
damp and heavy with the scent of wet earth and decaying vegetation, while the
sound of the river rushing by is a constant background murmur. The occasional
splash or rustle in the reeds hints at the presence of small animals or birds

plains flooding flooded water around river~
   As you stand on the edge of the river, you see vast plains stretching out
before you, their lush green grasses swaying gently in the breeze. However, the
river seems to have overflowed its banks, causing the plains to flood. The
water is murky and brown, and you can see small ripples forming as fish dart
around beneath the surface. The air is filled with the sounds of birds chirping
and insects buzzing, and you can smell the fresh, earthy scent of the wet soil.

copse riverside riverbank bank trees forest stumps around~
   As you approach the river, a small copse comes into view, nestled on the
bank. Some of the trees have been felled, leaving stumps of varying heights.
But amidst the stumps, there are signs of new growth: tiny saplings and young
trees are sprouting up, reaching for the light. The lush foliage of the
surrounding forest provides a natural barrier, casting a dappled shade over the
copse. The sound of the nearby river can be heard, its gentle current soothing

beach sandy shore water ocean sea desert around~
   The hot sand stretches for miles ahead, bordered by the calm waters of the
nearby sea. Gentle waves lap at the shoreline, leaving behind small bubbles
that quickly pop under the scorching sun. The occasional gust of wind causes
small whirlwinds of sand to dance across the beach, but otherwise the air is
still and dry. Sparse tufts of grass and shrubs cling to the edges of the
beach, their roots reaching deep into the sand in search of moisture. The beach
seems endless, inviting you to explore its vast expanse.

weathered by wind and salt spray. Jagged edges jut out sharply, creating deep
shadows that shift with the changing light. At the base of the cliffs, the
waves crash relentlessly against the rocks, sending up plumes of white foam.
Here and there, small caves and crevices can be seen, evidence of the ceaseless
erosion that has shaped this coastline over countless years.

estuary river water ocean sea around~
   The water is brackish and murky, reflecting the overcast sky above. Thick
clumps of reeds and grasses grow on the banks of the wide, slow-moving river
that flows into the sea. The current is gentle, but the water is still and
almost lifeless. Mudflats stretch out from the banks, and the ground is soft
and squishy underfoot. Gulls and other shorebirds wheel overhead, occasionally
diving into the water to snag a fish or crab. The air smells of salt and wet
earth, and the sounds of the waves and the birds mingle together in a soothing
symphony.

tree shoreside water ocean around~
   A lone tree stands on the edge of the ocean, its roots entwined in the sandy
soil. The constant sea breeze has sculpted its branches, creating a unique
shape that appears to be reaching towards the water. The trunk is rough and
weathered, the bark hardened by years of exposure to the salty air. Despite the
harsh environment, the tree appears healthy, with a crown of green leaves
swaying in the wind.

jungle edge sea seaside shore tree forest around~
   A large, gnarled tree stands at the edge of the jungle, its roots twisting
and intertwining with the sand and rocks of the shoreline. The tree's thick
trunk is covered in vines and moss, and its branches stretch out in all
directions, some reaching out over the water. The leaves of the tree are a
vibrant green, rustling in the sea breeze, and the sound of the waves crashing
against the shore can be heard in the distance. The tree provides a stark
contrast to the dense jungle behind it, and seems to be holding its own against
the relentless power of the ocean.

shore exstuary river water ocean sea around~
   The estuary shore is a mix of mud and sand, with the water slowly rising and
falling with the tide. Small crabs scurry around, digging into the sand and mud
for food. Seagulls and other shorebirds swoop down to grab small fish and other
creatures that have been stranded on the shore by the receding water. In the
distance, the sound of waves crashing against the rocky cliffs can be heard.
The air is salty and fresh, with a slight breeze blowing in from the sea.

sea. The water is crystal clear, revealing the vibrant colors of the coral and
sea plants below. The seabed is covered in a layer of fine sand, with
occasional rocks and shells scattered about. The water is shallow enough that
you can wade in it for quite a distance before it starts to get deeper.

rolling terrain that's scattered with patches of grass and low shrubs. The soil
here is loose and rocky, with occasional outcroppings of weathered stone that
jut out from the hillsides. Small streams trickle down from the higher
elevations, cutting through the soil and rock as they make their way towards
the lake. The foothills are quiet and peaceful, with only the sound of birdsong
and the rustle of leaves to break the stillness.

   You stand on the shore, looking at a row of stumps jutting out of the sand.
It's clear that a forest once stood here, but all that remains now are these
remnants of what was. Some of the stumps are larger, indicating that the trees
were older and more mature when they were cut down. Others are smaller, likely
the result of newer growth that was taken down before it could reach full
height. The area feels barren and desolate, a stark contrast to what it may
have looked like in the past.

vined densely field stumps jungle trees forest around~
   You step into a clearing amidst the dense jungle, only to find it marred by
a cluster of stumps. It's evident that the trees that once stood here have been
cut down, leaving behind a stark reminder of the human impact on the natural
world. The ground is littered with fallen branches and leaves, while a faint
scent of sawdust still lingers in the air. Despite the absence of trees, the
clearing is not entirely barren. New sprouts and shrubs are beginning to
emerge, perhaps signaling the start of a new chapter in this patch of land's
story.

stumps field trees forest irrigated irrigation canal around~
   You walk through an irrigated field where stumps of trees lie scattered
around. The trees have been cut down, leaving behind the stumps as the only
remnants of their presence. The field has been made fertile by the nearby
irrigation canal, allowing the growth of crops and vegetation to take place.
However, the absence of the trees is noticeable and adds a certain emptiness to
the area.

copse irrigated irrigation trees forest stumps around canal~
   As you walk through the irrigated field, you come across a small copse where
the trees have started to regrow. It's a vibrant and green area with young
saplings and tall trees reaching towards the sky. The lush foliage provides
ample shade and creates a cool, peaceful atmosphere. The sound of leaves
rustling in the breeze and birds chirping overhead adds to the tranquil
ambiance of this growing forest. The scent of fresh soil and vegetation fills
the air, making it easy to forget you are in the middle of a desert.

   You stand in a vast field, surrounded by the endless expanse of desert. But
here, where the ground is dark and rich, a vibrant green has emerged. You can
see the lines of a canal running through the center of the field, and small
shoots of plants pushing up through the damp soil. You can smell the fresh
scent of water and earth mixing together, a refreshing change from the dry air
of the desert. Looking closer, you can see the small seeds that have been
carefully planted, each one waiting to burst forth with new life.

   You are standing in a lush forest that has grown on the irrigated soil
around the canal. The trees around you are tall and sturdy, with their leaves
rustling in the breeze. The ground beneath your feet is covered in a thick
layer of leaves and other debris, making it soft and spongy to walk on. As you
look up, you can see glimpses of the sky through the canopy of leaves above
you. The air around you is fresh and cool, and you can hear the chirping of
birds and the rustling of leaves as the wind blows through the trees.

   Ahead of you, you see what appears to be an oasis, but as you draw closer,
you realize that it is completely dry. The ground is cracked and parched, and
the plants that once grew here have withered and died. The air is still and
hot, and you feel the intense heat of the sun beating down upon you. The
silence is broken only by the sound of your footsteps as you move across the
dry, barren landscape.

forest trees old-growth oldgrowth growth plants around up~
   As you stand amidst the towering giants, you can't help but feel small.
These trees have stood for centuries, reaching heights that seem to scrape the
sky. The ground is blanketed in a thick layer of fallen needles and leaves,
muffling your footsteps. You can see the occasional small clearing where
sunlight streams through the canopy above. This is a forest that has never been
touched by human hands, and it's full of the most sought-after lumber for
shipbuilding and construction.

field seeded seeds plants crop desert around~
   You are standing in a parched desert landscape, but amidst the sandy
terrain, you see the beginnings of life. Rows of small, fragile plants poke
through the dry earth, their leaves a vibrant green against the muted tones of
the desert. The tiny sprouts are an oasis in this barren environment, their
delicate shoots reaching up towards the sky. It's too early to tell what kind
of crop is being grown here, but the signs of growth are a hopeful sign in a
place where survival is a constant struggle. As you look around, you can't help
but wonder what this small plot of land will yield in the weeks and months to
come.
