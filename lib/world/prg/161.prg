Not Words But Tongues Hurt~
   You've found a way to bind hydra bones, together with a hydra's tongue. 
Sticks and stones may break bones, but words can't hurt you... Where does using
a tongue to hurt your enemies come in to this? Now you've got an oceanic tower,
you can purchase an upgrade to the next level of protection.

Oceanic Tower Upgrade~
   The oceanic guard towers are nice, but can they be more deadly? They most
certainly can, with this upgrade your oceanic towers will deal out more damage
to those you don't want in your city.
