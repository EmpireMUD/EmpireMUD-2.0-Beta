#12500
Parts of the Colossus~
   A powerful colossus roams our land. Surely no good can come of such a
clockwork creation. Climb the colossus, disable it, and defeat it. Build a
clockwork boot as a trophy for the empire -- surely such a unique vehicle would
bring us glory! (The tasks are listed twice on this goal because there are two
different versions of the colossus.)
