Superior Guard Towers~
   Your empire can now upgrade guard towers a second time. Superior guard
towers deal more damage and cannot be burned down. However, they are still
vulnerable to siege damage. Type 'upgrade' inside an advanced guard tower to
upgrade it to superior.

Defending the Empire~
   Build and upgrade 64 superior guard towers around your empire. For the best
defense, alternate guard towers and walls every other tile, so your enemies
can't circle around the towers.

Great Walls~
   Your empire can now build great walls across mountain ranges ('build
greatwall'). Aside from being built on mountains and costing more iron, they
are otherwise identical to regular walls. You can also build river gates, which
act like gatehouses for ships.
