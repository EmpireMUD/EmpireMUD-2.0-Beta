Henge Construction~
   Like the druids of old, your empire has learned to construct henges from
megalithic stones. These henges can be used to learn the secrets of the druids
and the path of Natural Magic.

Sorcery Tower Construction~
   Building a tower that stretches to the sky is no small feat, but your empire
has earned this knowledge. You can build the Tower of Sorcery, which will
attract a High Sorcerer and allow members of your empire to learn the arcane
arts. Sorcery towers can only be built inside your cities.

Stilt Buildings~
   Through extensive development and training, your empire has learned to build
on stilts over water, allowing you to drain swamps and oases, as well as stilt
houses and other useful seaside structures. Building the swamp platform will
convert a swamp tile to plains, while building drainage will convert an oasis
to desert.

Swamp Engineering~
   Though the swamps are uninviting -- and sometimes downright hostile -- your
empire has learned to build strong buildings amid the water and humidity. This
reward will let you build the swampwalk, a road that can safely cross the
swamp, as well as the swamp hut, swamp manor, and swamp complex.

Mountain Engineering~
   Your engineers have learned to build stable buildings into the sides of the
mountains. This unlocks multiple mountain buildings and also grants you the
'tunnel' command.

Vampire Havens~
   Vampires prefer a certain dramatic ambiance for their homes, and they
require lightproof walls. Your empire can now build four exquisite havens for
the refined taste of its night-dwellers.

Faster Excavations~
   Everyone in your empire now excavates (and fills in) faster when in one of
your cities. The city must be fully established (and no longer have the "new"
tag).
