Mysteries in the Shadow of Henge~
   No one knows why the ancients built the first henges, but they have become
an enduring symbol of the mysteries that lie beneath the surface of the world.
Now, your empire has learned to construct these monumental henges from
megalithic stone. In the shadow of these henges, you can learn the secrets of
Natural Magic and follow the path of the manaweavers.
   The henge requires 120x (large blocks).

Sorcery Tower Construction~
   Building a tower that stretches to the sky is no small feat, but your empire
has earned this knowledge. You can build the Tower of Sorcery, which will
attract a High Sorcerer and allow members of your empire to learn the arcane
arts. Sorcery towers can only be built inside your cities.
   The sorcery tower requires 80x (lumber), 40x (blocks), 5x ingot of
nocturnium, and 4x gold ingot.

Stilt Buildings~
   Through extensive development and training, your empire has learned to build
on stilts over water, allowing you to drain swamps and oases, as well as stilt
houses and other useful seaside structures. Building the swamp platform will
convert a swamp tile to plains, while building drainage will convert an oasis
to desert.

Swamp Engineering~
   Though the swamps are uninviting -- and sometimes downright hostile -- your
empire has learned to build strong buildings amid the water and humidity. This
reward will let you build the swampwalk, a road that can safely cross the
swamp, as well as the swamp hut, swamp manor, and swamp complex.

Mountain Engineering~
   Your engineers have learned to build stable buildings into the sides of the
mountains. This unlocks multiple mountain buildings and also grants you the
'tunnel' command.

Vampire Havens~
   Vampires prefer a certain dramatic ambiance for their homes, and they
require lightproof walls. Your empire can now build four exquisite havens for
the refined taste of its night-dwellers.

Faster Excavations~
   Everyone in your empire now excavates (and fills in) faster when in one of
your cities. The city must be fully established (and no longer have the "new"
tag).

Portalmancy~
   Your community has grown to include sorcerers unaccustomed to the rigors of
overland travel. With them, they bring the promise of a new form of magic:
portals. Your empire can now build the structures that anchor portals and allow
travel across the land.
   Building a portal costs 20x (pillars), 12x (large blocks), and 20x nexus
crystals. Once built, any member of the empire can open a portal between two
such buildings on the same island or continent.

Livestock Livelihood~
   In order to satiate your empire's appetite for meat and eggs, it can now
build chicken coops, pastures, and pigsties. Your workforce will produce eggs,
poultry, mutton, wool, and pork from these outdoor buildings.
