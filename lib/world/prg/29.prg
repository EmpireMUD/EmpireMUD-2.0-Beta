To the Tavern When the Job's Done~
   A thriving workforce is the heartbeat of any empire. But when the workday is
over, there's one thing they want: ale. The time is right to build some taverns
and create a successful brewing industry. The tavern might even attract some
interesting characters.
   Building a tavern requires 10x (lumber), 4x (nails), 12x (bricks),
20x (stiff plant fibers), 20x bushel of hops, and 20x sack of barley.
   Crafting barrels requires a carpenter, 1x (lumber), and 1x (common metal
ingot). Workforce will craft these at the carpenter, as well.
Workforce will craft the following items at the tavern:
   barrel of ale: wooden barrel, 5x sack of barley, 5x bushel of hops
   barrel of lager: wooden barrel, 5x bushel of corn, 5x bushel of hops
   barrel of wheat beer: wooden barrel, 5x bundle of wheat, 5x sack of barley
   barrel of cider: wooden barrel, 5x bunch of apples, 5x basket of peaches
