Abundant Water~
   Your empire will need a good source of water. Carrying jugs from the river
every day grows tiring. Build a well to ensure easy access to water. You will
be able to drink from the well, or fill your bottle from it. Be sure to claim
the well in order to complete this goal.

allies. Lay (and claim) at least 250 roads to complete this goal.

Luxuries~
   The poorest people walk the longest distances to water. But for the rich,
water flows from ever corner. Build a fountain and some baths so that your
citizens can enjoy the greatest luxury of all: flowing water. Completing this
goal will give you the ability to build the portcullis and greathall buildings,
which serve as the entrances for castles. It also gives you steps, a nicer
version of roads for your cities, as well as a luxury ship called the carrack.

Castle~
   Build a castle, starting with a great hall or portcullis (or mountain hall).
Usually castles involve interlinking more than one of these buildings and
adding walls around them, but finishing the first great hall or portcullis will
complete this goal.
