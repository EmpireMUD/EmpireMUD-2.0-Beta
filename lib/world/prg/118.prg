The Tower Skycleave~
   The Tower Skycleave, an infamous school of sorcery with enough power to
ensure it stands for all time, faces imminent peril! The tower's vast tools and
treasures are under the control of mercenaries, pixies, goblins... and worse.
There's no telling what will happen if Skycleave is allowed to fall into the
wrong hands. You must rescue the tower in time, for the glory of the empire!

The Skycleave Variations~
   The Tower Skycleave is stuck in a time loop, where the same events play out
over and over, seemingly without end. But not everything in the tower is set in
stone. Small ripples lead to subtle variations, perhaps even changing the fate
of the tower and its occupants. Seek them out -- the villains, foes, and
adversaries that hide in the tower alike -- and defeat them... for the glory
of the empire!

Legacy of Skycleave~
   The high sorcerers of Skycleave made a monumental impact on the world and
their legacy can be felt across the land. Show off your empire's place in this
lasting legacy by constructing the tremendous buildings designed by its
incomparable magineers and growing one of its rare and magical forests.
   To complete this goal, you need to own all three buildings and at least one
fully-grown Calamander Jungle tile.
