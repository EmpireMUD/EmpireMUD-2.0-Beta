All Hallow's Eve~
   When spooks and spirits and ghosts and gremlins come out from their hiding
places and haunt the world of the living, it can only be Halloween. Join in the
festivities by finding candies and completing quests, but do it fast because
the fun expires at the end of October.

Halloween of the Dead~
   Halloween comes but once a year, so we celebrate it with a month of revelry.
Show your holiday spirit by collecting candy and completing quests, and earn
this progress reward for your empire by winning the haunted snowglobe (750
threshold points), then use it to build the haunted mansion!

You Chose 'Treat'~
   Between the various members of your empire, you have collected a hundred
goody bags! Hope they're as fun to open as they were to collect.

The Unbelieveable Demon Tale~
   You've done it! You have killed the unkillable demon of the nether. That
destroyer of champions and heros alike is finally dead. Or, at least one of
them is. Your empire is certainly a force to be reckoned with.
