Seeds of Magic~
   The world is covered in forests from pole to pole, but most forests are of
little note. Legends tell of an enchanted forest which can be grown from a
single enchanted seed. Find the crystal seed, enchant it, and plant it to start
an enchanted forest for your empire. Be sure to claim the forest right away,
because a mysterious cult of necrovandals is known to destroy unclaimed magical
forests. Completing this goal earns your empire more territory per greatness.

Enchanted Forest~
   A single tree does not a forest make. Carefully tend and grow your enchanted
forest by keeping it surrounded by claimed Plains tiles, and by allowing it to
grow rather than chopping it down. Do this until you have 10 tiles of
fully-grown enchanted forests. Of course, you could always scour the Earth for
9 more crystal seeds and start your forests that way.

The Magic Grows~
   Though your empire has no need for a larger enchanted forest, you feel
strangely compelled to let the forest grow ever larger. Remember to keep the
tiles around your enchanted forest clear and claimed, and don't over-chop the
enchanted forest. To complete this goal, you must have 50 fully-grown enchanted
forest tiles all at once.

Rich Beyond Imagining~
   An empire can become rich through hard work and dedication. But to become
ludicrously rich -- rich beyond imagining -- will take considerably more. Mine
every mountain, sell to every empire, adventure until your vault is
overflowing. Reach 100000 wealth and be rewarded with another city point and
additional territory.
