Seeds of Magic~
   The world is covered in forests from pole to pole, but most forests are of
little note. Legends tell of an enchanted forest which can be grown from a
single enchanted seed. Find the crystal seed, enchant it, and plant it to start
an enchanted forest for your empire. Be sure to claim the forest right away,
because a mysterious cult of necrovandals is known to destroy unclaimed magical
forests. Completing this goal earns your empire more territory per greatness.

Enchanted Forest~
   A single tree does not a forest make. Carefully tend and grow your enchanted
forest by keeping it surrounded by claimed Plains tiles, and by allowing it to
grow rather than chopping it down. Do this until you have 10 tiles of
fully-grown enchanted forests. Of course, you could always scour the Earth for
9 more crystal seeds and start your forests that way.

Witchwood~
   Though your empire has no need for a larger enchanted forest, you feel
strangely compelled to let the forest grow ever larger. Remember to keep the
tiles around your enchanted forest clear and claimed, and don't over-chop the
enchanted forest. To complete this goal, you must have 50 fully-grown enchanted
forest tiles all at once.

Rowling in the Forest~
   Grow, claim, and control 500 tiles of enchanted forests to achieve this
monumental goal. This task will take time, care, patience, and a lot of
territory. But if you achieve it, your empire will see a level of greatness to
which most people dare not aspire.

The Only Thing Better Than Gold~
   Your empire has reached an historic level of wealth, and yet you yearn for
more. After all, the only thing better than gold is more gold. Reach 500000

Draconic Hoard~
   Those who say wealth is relative have clearly never had true wealth. Your
empire is practically swimming in gold, but that's not enough. Amass enough
wealth that a dragon could swim in your vault, and rival the hoards of the
greatest dragons that ever lived. You'll need 1000000 wealth to achieve this.
Good luck.

Rich Beyond Imagining~
   An empire can become rich through hard work and dedication. You already did
that. But to become ludicrously rich -- rich beyond imagining -- will take
considerably more. Mine every mountain, sell to every empire, slay every
dragon, adventure until your vault is overflowing, and don't spend a penny of
it. Reach 5000000 wealth and prove yours is the wealthiest empire of all time!
