Seeds of Magic~
   The world is covered in forests from pole to pole, but most forests are of
little note. Legends tell of an enchanted forest which can be grown from a
single enchanted seed. Find the crystal seed, enchant it, and plant it to start
an enchanted forest for your empire. Be sure to claim the forest right away,
because a mysterious cult of necrovandals is known to destroy unclaimed magical
forests. Completing this goal earns your empire more territory per greatness.

Draconic Hoard~
   Those who say wealth is relative have clearly never had true wealth. Your
empire is practically swimming in gold, but that's not enough. Amass enough
wealth that a dragon could swim in your vault, and rival the hoards of the
greatest dragons that ever lived. You'll need 1000000 wealth to achieve this.
Good luck.

Rich Beyond Imagining~
   An empire can become rich through hard work and dedication. You already did
that. But to become ludicrously rich -- rich beyond imagining -- will take
considerably more. Mine every mountain, sell to every empire, slay every
dragon, adventure until your vault is overflowing, and don't spend a penny of
it. Reach 5000000 wealth and prove yours is the wealthiest empire of all time!
