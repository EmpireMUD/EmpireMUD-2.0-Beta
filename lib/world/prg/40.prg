Seeds of Magic~
   The world is covered in forests from pole to pole, but most forests are of
little note. Legends tell of an enchanted forest which can be grown from a
single enchanted seed. Find the crystal seed, enchant it, and plant it to start
a starwood forest for your empire. Be sure to claim the forest right away,
because a mysterious cult of necrovandals is known to destroy unclaimed magical
forests. Completing this goal earns your empire more territory per greatness.

Draconic Hoard~
   Those who say wealth is relative have clearly never had true wealth. Your
empire is practically swimming in gold, but that's not enough. Amass enough
wealth that a dragon could swim in your vault, and rival the hoards of the
greatest dragons that ever lived. You'll need 1000000 wealth to achieve this.
Good luck.

   An empire can become rich through hard work and dedication. You already did
that. But to become ludicrously rich -- rich beyond imagining -- will take
considerably more. Mine every mountain, sell to every empire, slay every
dragon, adventure until your vault is overflowing, and don't spend a penny of
it. Reach 5000000 wealth and prove yours is the wealthiest empire of all time!

The Power to Move Forests~
   Your empire's members learn the ancient and arcane art of crafting crystal
seeds -- the same seeds used to grow enchanted forests. But this is not without
cost. Crafting the nascent crystal seed will require a powerful magic gem, a
fair amount of mana, and magewood aplenty. The crafter will also need to
possess the ability to Enchant Tools. Once crafted, the nascent crystal seed
must be awakened in a magical forest, draining that forest of its magic but
allowing the seed to be enchanted and planted elsewhere.

destroy them.
