A Fur-ocious Dragon~
   A fur dragon has been spotted in the area! These lithe, wily dragons are
known to keep fantastic golden treasures in their burrows. Hunt fur dragons
until you have recovered all three gold items. Hint: Some items are more common
on lower difficulty and others on higher difficulty.
