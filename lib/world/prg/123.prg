A Fur-ocious Dragon~
   A fur dragon has been spotted in the area! These lithe, wily dragons are
known to keep fantastic golden treasures in their burrows. Hunt fur dragons
until you have recovered all three gold items. Hint: Some items are more common
on lower difficulty and others on higher difficulty.

Legend of the Hoarfrost Serragon~
   Scouts report an enormous serragon in the area, and it sounds like a vicious
one. There are rumors that the desert around its lair has frozen over and your
sources believe this is the deadly hoarfrost serragon. Slaying such a beast
would surely bring glory to the empire. Defeat the serragon -- several, if you
have to -- and bring back an in-tact skull. Build a shrine to the creature so
that the whole world can see the empire's might!
