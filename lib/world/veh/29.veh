An imperial carriage is parked here.~
   This carriage is made from wood but highlighted in glimmering imperium. It
looks like it has lots of storage space, perfect for the traveling monarch.

caravan heroic~
a heroic caravan~
A heroic caravan of adventurers is parked here.~
   The caravan is made up of several massive carriages, some chained to each
other and the rest pulled by their own steeds. The caravan is made from exotic
wood and well-appointed with golden highlights, and surely belongs to the
world's most successful adventurers.

a heroic galleon~
A heroic galleon of adventurers is floating here.~
   The galleon is an absolutely massive ship, large enough to be a city in
itself. It appears to be made from some exotic wood, and sits higher in the
water than an ordinary ship.
