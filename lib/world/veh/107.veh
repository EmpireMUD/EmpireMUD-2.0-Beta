the sleigh~
A sleek red sleigh is parked here.~
   The sleigh is small, but there's a curious red sack in the back that seems
to hold a great deal.

raft shoddy~
a shoddy raft~
A shoddy raft is barely holding itself together.~
   The raft is made from large sticks and some very worn-out twine. You can
'drag' the raft to the edge of the water, then 'sit' on it and type 'sail
<direction>'.
