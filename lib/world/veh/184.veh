schooner prairie wagon~
a prairie schooner~
A prairie schooner is being led by a team of stout oxen.~
   This old wagon has seen better days. The wheels are mismatched and the axle
is stressed almost to the point of breaking. It's such a rough ride that your
entire family is walking alongside, rather than sitting in the wagon.

a strange silver chariot~
There is a strange silver chariot with doors like the wings of gulls.~
   This chariot is unlike anything you have ever seen. It is short, wide, and
flattened, and its wheels are made of a dark material like none you have ever
seen. The doors raise vertically, held aloft like gulls' wings, revealing a
plush and extravagant interior.

the blue box~
A tall blue box has appeared here, seemingly from nowhere.~
   The box is taller than a man, and has a door on the front. Words in a
strange script appear to spell out 'Police Box'. The box is painted a deep
shade of blue and though it has windows, you can't see in.
