There is a trapper's post here.~
   The trapper's post is little more than a cabin and some tents surrounded by
trees. Racks of meat hang in the smoke near the billowing fire and along every
wall are fresh skins hanging to dry. The pungent smell of the smoking meat and
drying leather leaves a hollow feeling in your stomach, and your mouth begins
to water.

A collection of sand-colored trapper's tents are set up here.~
   Various snake skins, spotted furs, and other assorted hides hang from hooks
on the sides of a collection of sandy tents. A smoky fire burns in a pit
between the tents. Jerky is slowly drying on racks near the fire.

the trapper's post~
There is a trapper's post hanging among the vines.~
   The trapper's post is made from a collection of small shacks hanging on the
sides of the trees, up off of the overgrown jungle floor. The only part of the
post at ground level is the fire pit.
