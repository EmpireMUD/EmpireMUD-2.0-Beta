A young atlasian tortoise towers over you.~
   The tortoise, though young, is taller than a house. What's more, there's a
house set upon its back, built on a wooden platform and strapped on with a
heavy leather strap. The tortoise stops periodically to munch on the foliage,
so you're not sure how it ever gets anywhere.
