the flying sleigh~
A sleek red sleigh is flying here.~
   The sleigh is small, but there's a curious red sack in the back that seems
to hold a great deal. This sleigh appears to be flying! Use the 'pilot' command
to fly it.

the giant straw goat~
A giant straw goat looms over you.~
   This enormous goat has been constructed from straw, wood, and rope to
celebrate the Yule season. Its long, curved horns are dusted with snow at the
top, well out of reach. The entire goat is decorated with an enormous red
ribbon, which really brings the whole thing together.
