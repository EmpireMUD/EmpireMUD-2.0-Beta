the clockwork roc~
A clockwork roc soars above you.~
   The clockwork roc is essentially a giant sailing ship, but in place of sails
it has powerful wooden wings lined with the massive feathers of a roc.
Whatever engineer created this flying ship shall surely go down in history, if
not in the mountains.
