an enchanted rainbow~
An enchanted rainbow streams down from the sky!~
   Though it looks like an ordinary rainbow, this one has been enchanted to be
solid, almost like a flying carriage. The rainbow twists and untwists itself as
it moves, shimmering up into the sky and back down again. You can sit on the
rainbow and pilot it around.
