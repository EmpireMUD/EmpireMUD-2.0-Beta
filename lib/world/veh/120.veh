stormcloud cloud menacing ba'al baal hadad~
the stormcloud of Ba'al Hadad~
A menacing stormcloud hovers just above the ground.~
   The stormcloud twists and roils, flashing as it releases bolts of lightning,
and roaring with thunder as it moves. Truly this is the chariot of Ba'al Hadad,
storm god of the ancient world.
