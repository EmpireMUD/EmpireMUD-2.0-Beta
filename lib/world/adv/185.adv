The Lost Temple~
Owen Morris and Paul Clarke~
   You have discovered an ancient, overgrown temple deep in the jungle. Surely
its depths must hold great undiscovered treasures of an ancient civilization,
if you're brave enough to venture below...
   This adventure features a difficulty selector so it can be completed solo,
or in groups of up to four. All gear looted from this adventure will be higher
quality on harder difficulties.
   Beware! Dungeons such as this one often have traps. &cSEARCH&0 carefully before
advancing, or be prepared to &cJUMP&0, &cDUCK&0 or &cRUN&0 very fast.
