Hamlet of the Undead~
Paul Clarke~
   Smoke and fire in the distance have led you to a small hamlet, ablaze and
beset by the undead. Most of the citizens have fled, but it looks as if those
who remain could use your help. With no army to come to its rescue, you might
be the hamlet's only hope!

The Sewer: Goblin Outpost~
Paul Clarke~
   Strange sounds are coming from the sewer grate, and waste has been backing
up into the streets. This can only mean one thing: Goblins! Will you buy the
goblins' wares, or drive them from the city? This adventure sells 30 BoE items,
the crafting patterns BoE for them all, and 4 unique buildings. You can also
fight the goblins solo or in pairs (on normal, hard, or group difficulty) to
earn their prized gear.
   The gear sold in the shops is the same as the gear created by the crafting
patterns and the loot dropped by the goblins except for the levels and flags:
- Loot from defeating goblins: levels 50-50, normal/hard/group difficulty, BoP
- Purchased items: levels 1-175, normal difficulty, BoE
- Crafted items: levels 1-175, normal or superior, BoE
See HELP GOBLIN OUTPOST for craft info.
