Invasion of: The Goblin Necromancer~
Domino~
   A hole has been discovered leading into pitch black somewhere in the
empire's land. Adventurers from the guild claim that a goblin necromancer has
been seen about lately, performing experiments. Someone needs to put a stop to
things. After all, who knows what his end goal is?
