#12500
Clockwork Colossus~
Paul Clarke and Owen Morris~
   A towering clockwork man stomps across the landscape, paying little
attention to what he might step on -- if it is a he -- as he marches inexorably
toward an unseen goal. Few have ever beheld such a marvel as this colossus, and
fewer still have managed to fell one and see what makes it tick.
   This adventure has 6 difficulty settings. To lower the difficulty of the
colossus, you must '&cboard&0' it and sabotage its massive metal mechanisms. Each
piece lowers the difficulty by one level, with the exception of the feet.
Disabling the feet will return the colossus to its scaffolding, where you can
summon fellow adventurers to aid in the fight.
   You can '&cdisembark&0' from the colossus at any time, but be careful not to let
it throw you off from great height. The colossus shoots powerful laser beams
from its eyes, so be prepared to type '&rdodge&0'.
