garden. But this is no ordinary place. Help the druid gardener with a few
simple requests, and be transported to the Magiterranean, the secret world of

Magiterranean: Interdimensional Whirlwind~
Paul Clarke and Owen Morris~
   The magical whirlwind seems to be a portal between this plane and the
Magiterranean, the secret realm of druids. You can't seem to penetrate the
whirlwind, but it looks like the druids have been using it to spread their
magi-netically modified crops into our world.
(This adventure contains only the magical crops on the map.)

Magiterranean: Monsoon Rift~
Paul Clarke and Owen Morris~
   A rift has opened in the fabric between your world and the Magiterranean,
the druidic plane of nature magic. A vicious monsoon storm is escaping through
the rift, but it's not the only thing: animated cacti are attacking your world!
   You can seal the rift using your Battle, High Sorcery, Natural Magic,
Stealth, Trade, or Vampire skill. Each skill solution can only be completed
once per day, even if you find another rift. The invading cacti will vanish as
soon as you close the rift.

Ruins: Thieves~
Paul Clarke~
   You've stumbled onto somebody's campsite in the ruins. From the looks of
things, it's not someone living the high life. Some of the items appear to be
quite valuable, so it's safe to assume the person camping here is not the legal
owner of any of these things.

Ruins: The Goblin Challenge~
Paul Clarke~
   The ruins have attracted a nest of goblins, and you'll have to clear them
out before the ruins can be removed. That might not be easy, as you have
stumbled upon the Goblin Challenge. Goblins might be small, but they aren't
known to fight fair. Play this encounter in phases, increasing in difficulty.
This adventure locks its level when you start combat, so check if it's already
locked before you start.

A Gigantic Nest~
Paul Clarke and Owen Morris~
   You have stumbled across a gigantic nest, woven together from entire trees,
perched inelegantly on the landscape. The nest's owner is nowhere to be seen,
but a single, huge, warm egg is gently rocking in the center. It looks like the
egg could hatch any time.
   There are several quests to choose from each time you find one of these
nests, but you can only do one per nest. Save up your rewards and buy new
crafting patterns and items at the end of the quest.
   This is a solo adventure. Only one player can enter the nest at a time.

The Sewer: Ratskins~
Paul Clarke~
   Your city has grown, and it's not easy having so many people living so
closely together. Sewers squirrel away the dirtiest parts of society, keeping
the foul stench of mankind's unmentionable waste out of sight, and out of mind.
But the sewer attracts two more of society's unwanted: the poor, and the rats.

sorcerers and unconventional research. It funds its discoveries through patents

the past! Follow Archsorcerer Malfernes through the portal and explore the
Primeval Era, when the ancient ancestors of the dragons ruled endless jungles.

the dracosaurs.
