Magiterranean: The Grove~
Paul Clarke~
   A small grove deep in the Magiterranean, the plane of nature magic. This is
a place where the forces of nature run deep, and interlopers are unwelcome.

forests.

Magiterranean: The Hidden Garden~
Paul Clarke~
   You find a hidden garden, nestled through a hole in the bushes of another
garden. But this is no ordinary place. Help the druid gardener with a few
simple requests, and be transported to the Magiterranean, the secret world of
druids! You can do this quest alone or with friends, but there's no combat
here. This adventure is for farmers and gardeners.

Magiterranean: Interdimensional Whirlwind~
Paul Clarke and Owen Morris~
   The magical whirlwind seems to be a portal between this plane and the
Magiterranean, the secret realm of druids. You can't seem to penetrate the
whirlwind, but it looks like the druids have been using it to spread their
magi-netically modified crops into our world.
(This adventure contains only the magical crops on the map.)

The Swamp Hag~

   You have stumbled upon a strange, raised house in the swamp. It's old,
dilapidated, and surrounded by unfriendly swamp creatures. What sort of person
would live like this?

Ruins: Three Banditos~
Paul Clarke~
   It looks like someone has been camping out in these ruins. You've found the
hideout of infamous bandits Berk, Jorr, and Tranc! These three are not renowned
for fighting fair, but if you're lucky, maybe only one of them is home.

Ruins: Thieves~
Paul Clarke~
   You've stumbled onto somebody's campsite in the ruins. From the looks of
things, it's not someone living the high life. Some of the items appear to be
quite valuable, so it's safe to assume the person camping here is not the legal
owner of any of these things.

Ruins: The Goblin Challenge~
Paul Clarke~
   The ruins have attracted a nest of goblins, and you'll have to clear them
out before the ruins can be removed. That might not be easy, as you have
stumbled upon the Goblin Challenge. Goblins might be small, but they aren't
known to fight fair. Play this encounter in phases, increasing in difficulty.
This adventure locks its level when you start combat, so check if it's already
locked before you start.

Abandoned Dragon Nest~
Paul Clarke~
   The dragon nest appears abandoned, which means a dragon is on the loose
nearby. Can you find and defeat it? Be careful, it might take a pair of stout
adventurers -- but the rewards will be worth it.

The Sewer: Ratskins~
Paul Clarke~
   Your city has grown, and it's not easy having so many people living so
closely together. Sewers squirrel away the dirtiest parts of society, keeping
the foul stench of mankind's unmentionable waste out of sight, and out of mind.
But the sewer attracts two more of society's unwanted: the poor, and the rats.

The Sewer: Goblin Outpost~
Paul Clarke~
   Strange sounds are coming from the sewer grate, and waste has been backing
up into the streets. This can only mean one thing: Goblins! Will you buy the
goblins' wares, or drive them from the city? This adventure sells 6 crafting
patterns and 4 unique buildings. You can also fight the goblins solo or in
pairs, to earn their prized gear.

The Tower Skycleave~
Paul Clarke~
   The Tower Skycleave is renowned throughout the land for its powerful
sorcerers and unconventional research. It funds its discoveries through patents
and tourism, and a sign out front eagerly encourages you to visit. Parts of the
tower are designed for different level ranges, so use the 'consider' command
judiciously before you attack things.

Portal to the Primeval~
Paul Clarke~
   The High Sorcerers in your tower have managed to open a chronoportal into
the past! Follow Archsorcerer Malfernes through the portal and explore the
Primeval Era, when the ancient ancestors of the dragons ruled endless jungles.
But beware, because it's easy to get lost and you make a delicious snack for
the dracosaurs.
