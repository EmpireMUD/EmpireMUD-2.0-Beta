Fur Dragon~
Paul Clarke~
   It looks like you've found a legendary fur dragon... Or perhaps it has found
you! These warm-blooded dragons live in burrows and stalk their prey -- which
ranges from bison to elephants -- from the shadows. They're known to retreat to
their den when threatened. Follow it inside if you dare, but be warned that few
adventurers come back out.
   This adventure features a new 'study' mechanic. By studying the chewed-up,
mangled, and downright tattered gear that the fur dragon has collected from
other adventurers, you can create crafting patterns for those same items.
Studying consumes at least one of the items, depending on the item's quality.
