Oceanic Hydra~
Domino~
   A monstrous hydra has been terrorizing the coasts of islands and continents
alike. A group of adventurers should hunt down this beast and put it down, for
the good of the empire. The hydra has proven to be resistant to all forms of
harm, except for a short period of time after one of its heads is destroyed.
