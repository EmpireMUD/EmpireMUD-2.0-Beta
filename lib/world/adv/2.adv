The Cursed Chalice of Mill Manor~
JL Decker~
   Once, Mill Manor was a grand estate, prosperous and beloved by all who lived
there. But then, a terrible pestilence settled over the land, and misfortune
cast it into decline. Today, although it is a wretched speck of its glorious
past, yet tales still circle of how valuable those lands would be again, if
only the curse were reversed.

Goblin Logging Camp~
Owen Morris~
   Something has been clearing vast swathes of the woodland to build some kind
of war machine here! Judging by the smell, only two kinds of pest could have
been responsible: goblins, or urchins. Judging by the warg bone tent poles,
it's probably not urchins. Burning their camp to the ground or killing them
should drive them from the region.
