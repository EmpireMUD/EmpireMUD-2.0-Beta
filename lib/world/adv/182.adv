#18200
The Guild of Adventurers~
Paul Clarke and Owen Morris~
   The atlasian tortoise roams across the countryside, chewing a steady diet of
treetops and adventure. Bolted to its back is a huge platform, upon which
someone has built a grand tavern. You have heard rumors that the Guild of
Adventurers uses a tortoise like this one as its base of operations. What else
might await inside the tavern?

Notes for implementors:
- This adventure uses fixed-location instances.
- You should pick large, open areas as spawn points.
- One spawn point per continent is usually enough.
- This adventure was designed to spawn next to ocean, on a plains or desert.
- Create a spawn location:
 .map build 18200
 .map unclaimable
- Edit this adventure and set its limit to the number of spawn points you added.
- Remove the IN-DEV flag from the adventure.
