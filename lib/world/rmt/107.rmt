A Winter Wonderland~
   You're standing knee-deep in snow at the base of a small mountain. Steps
have been carved from ice, but a fierce blizzard is quickly covering them in
snow. Behind the whip and howl of the wind, you can hear people singing carols.

A Winter Wonderland~
   The icy staircase spirals around the mountain. Now that you're above the
blizard, the beauty of the snow-covered peak is striking. Evergreen trees
frosted in glittering snow give you the warm feeling of home.

A Winter Wonderland~
   The snowy mountain peak rises above the winter blizzard below, and tracks in
the snow tell you that you're not the only one here. You can hear carolers
singing in the distance, and the smell of cookies fills the air with warmth.

A Winter Wonderland~
   The side of the mountain is covered in picturesque snow, all fresh and
fluffy as though it just fell. Below, you can see the top of a harsh winter
blizzard. But though it is cold up here, you're warmed by visions of sugarplums
dancing in your head.

A Winter Wonderland~
   The icy stairs which wind up the whole of the mountain are finally near the
peak, and you have found the source of the lovely music that fills the cold
mountain air. You're above even the evergreen trees here, surrounded by nothing
but the untouched beauty of the snow.

world, surrounded by the joy of carolers below, you cannot help but be caught
up in the spirit of the holiday.

A Mine Shaft~
   At the bottom of the ladder, and just beyond the reach of the outside light,
you find the entrance to the mine shaft. The walls appear to have been scraped
clear by picks -- and possibly claws. Little ore remains.

A Mine Shaft~
   The mine shaft twists around on itself, slowly sloping downward. A
chittering sound comes from lower in the mine, and you can't help but notice
that the walls here have a lot of spiderwebs on them.

An Old Mining Tunnel~
   The floor clings to your feet as you step, and you realize that every inch
of the tunnel is covered in spiderwebs. You think you can see eyes reflecting
your light, but maybe if you are very lucky, those will turn out to be precious
gems instead.

An Old Mining Tunnel~
   The spiderwebs are thicker here, and you notice more than one spot where it
looks like something was cocooned into the walls. It makes you wonder how many
goblins were working this old mine.

A Web-Covered Cavern~
   The tunnel in the goblin mine breaks through into a natural cavern here.
There's no evidence of mining, so perhaps the goblins broke through only to
find themselves in a spider's nest.

A Web-Covered Cavern~
   You have reached the end of the spiderweb-filled cavern, and this is clearly
the nest of a very large spider. Empty egg sacs dangle from every stalactite.
Trails of rust run from old cocoons. And there is a distinct chittering noise
that tells you trouble is not far.
