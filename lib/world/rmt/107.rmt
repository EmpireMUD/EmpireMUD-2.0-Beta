A Winter Wonderland~
   You're standing knee-deep in snow at the base of a small mountain. Steps
have been carved from ice, but a fierce blizzard is quickly covering them in
snow. Behind the whip and howl of the wind, you can hear people singing carols.

A Winter Wonderland~
   The snowy mountain peak rises above the winter blizzard below, and tracks in
the snow tell you that you're not the only one here. You can hear carolers
singing in the distance, and the smell of cookies fills the air with warmth.

A Winter Wonderland~
   The side of the mountain is covered in picturesque snow, all fresh and
fluffy as though it just fell. Below, you can see the top of a harsh winter
blizzard. But though it is cold up here, you're warmed by visions of sugarplums
dancing in your head.

but the untouched beauty of the snow.
