An Earthen Tunnel~
   With a rounded roof, walls, and even a slightly rounded floor, this is
clearly not a finished tunnel. Scratches and roughly pressed dirt give an
impression of utility and not beauty, while strange tracks seem to indicate
something uncommon has taken up residence.

A Hollowed Out Cavern~
   Here the tunnel opens up into a cavern. While still not large, there is a
clear feel of empty space that was absent before. All around, those same tracks
from before can be seen, moving back and forth across the floor.

Experimentation Chamber~
   All throughout this chamber you see signs of horrific experiments going on:
here a dragon's tooth embedded in the skull of some animal, there vines growing
through a skeleton in mimicry of a circulatory system. It seems someone has
been trying to use nature magic to resurrect the long since dead.

A Small Tunnel~
   This tunnel leads off of the central meeting area, as shown by the tracks,
and leads further down into the ground. Far less tracks can be found here, and
only half of them are the strange looking ones from before. Other noticeable
tracks are clearly from goblin feet.

A Structurally Sound Tunnel~
   The further down you go, the more solid the walls and ceiling seem to
become. It almost seems as though someone worked from underground up. The
abnormal tracks are almost completely gone from the floor now, and just the
goblin footsteps show up as signs of constant passage.

The Guard Room~
   Coming to the end of the tunnel, you're in yet another chamber. This time,
however, the chamber is almost modern in its construction. There's no chance of
finding tracks on the floor, because it is made of some sort of smoothed stone.
The walls are striped by supports and even the ceiling shows signs of some
solid workmanship.

The Goblin's Altar~
   Darkness cloaks this altar, more than just the dark of being underground.
An almost tangible cloud of wrongness blankets the room. The scent of blood is
strong, and probably could be felt too, if you were willing to place a hand on
the ritual stones.

The Goblin's Chambers~
   The walls here are made of lovingly crafted stone and covered in what seems
to be several runic languages. Years of work are clearly displayed in the
writing alone, but also in the tomes littering the floor.
