The Grand Foyer~
   The planning office is small, but the foyer is furnished with seating for a
dozen people while they wait to see one of the royal officials who office here.
A sign on the wall reads 'Ye Olde Empire Tutorial'.

The Forestry Office~
   This office is made from wood so fresh that it's still dripping sap. It
looks like the ranger has used some of this sap to hold papers to the wall.
Two deer heads adorn the far wall, but these appear to be held up with nails.

papers~
   The papers are held up with sticky sap that has leaked through and made some
of them illegible. The rest appear to be hunting permits.

The City Planner~
   The planning office is superbly tidy, with shelf upon shelf of neatly
labeled books. One wall has a map of the island with tiny flags pinned in
various places. Another wall has a painting of a woman.

The Adviser's Office~
   This office is decked in richly stained wood and trimmed in gold leaf. Deep
purple curtains and an oversized, fur-lined chair suggest the office is
well-supplied by the crown. That, or the adviser is ostentatiously pretentious.

The Museum of Early Man~
   The cave opens into a single, large room. Rickety shelves line the walls,
though the shelves sit empty. It looks as if the proprieter is trying to set up
a museum, but doesn't have any authentic artifacts.

A Bright Cave in the Mountainside~
   This small cave would be easy to miss from a distance, if not for the light
spilling out of it. The floor has a walkway made from wooden planks, and it
looks like someone has been building a shop in the back.

The Museum of Early Man~
   The cave opens into a large, single room. Shelves of artifacts line the
walls, from stone tools to pottery and even musical instruments. It looks like
Horation has gone to a lot of trouble to exhibit the simple tools that mankind
used in its rise from humble apes to great empires.

   The stone tools look very finely crafted, as if they were made by a modern
artisan rather than a primitive, brutish man.

pots pottery~
   The pots are finely made and relatively undecorated. One is broken, although
it looks like it was struck open by a chisel.

The Soulstream~
   You find yourself in a whirling maelstrom, as if the very fabric of reality
is spinning around you. Vividly colorful clouds and blinding beams of light
whoosh past you, through the portal, and out into the real world.

A Hidden Part of the Soulstream~
   The wild, colorful swirls of the Soulstream whip around you, sometimes
clinging to your feet as you step over them. There's no physical substance here
to stand on, but you have no trouble moving from place to place. You'll have to
go back south to get to the exit portal.

but if you focus, you can still look out over the world.
