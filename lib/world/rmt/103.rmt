A Scorched Nest~
   It looks like something has built a nest from scorched branches at the back
of the cave. From the looks of the nest, it must be at least the size of a
full-grown man. And from the burning embers, it probably isn't far away.

Inside a Massive Nest~
   You have climbed into a massive dragon nest, made from giant branches and
whole trees. It's difficult to tell how long since the dragon was last here,
but it did leave scorch marks.
