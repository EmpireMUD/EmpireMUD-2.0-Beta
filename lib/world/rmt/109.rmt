A Dark, Musty Cave~
   The cave system has many branches, but most are either collapsed or too
small to enter. Several have massive claw marks suggesting the dragon has tried
to pursue its prey into the side passages. There are also clear signs that
adventurers have come this way before, but most tracks lead into the cave
rather than out of it.

The Dragon's Lair~
   You have stumbled into a dragon's lair! The mammoth cave has ended in a
truly gigantic chamber, and it seems a dragon has made its home in it. The back
of the cave is dominated by a huge nest, apparently made from whole trees. No
creature but a red dragon builds a nest so large. To the side, you can see
charred bits of armor, perhaps returned from the dragon's sensitive stomach.

A Small Side Passage~
   This tiny side passage barely fits a small party of humans, and is far too
small for the dragon to enter. It looks as if a knight has set up camp in here,
perhaps to prepare to fight the dragon. Claw marks at the entrance show that
the dragon has tried to thwart the knight more than once.

A Hole in the Muck~
   When it's time to shed their skin, muck dragons pupate underground in the
swamp for several days. This hole is rather large, indicating that it wasn't a
small dragon resting here. This one has already emerged. Perhaps it is nearby?
