A Crude Hut~
   The hut overlooks the swamp, but it offers no protection from the many
insects that swarm outside. The inside of the hut is a single room, cluttered
with furs that have been turned into crude dolls and furniture made from
strange bones. This is not the sort of place most people would choose to live.

The Back Room~
   Like the rest of the building, the back room lies in ruins. The walls are
partially collapsed and provide at best minimal protection from the elements.
There are three bedrolls by the best wall, and a tiny fire beneath a missing
section of roof.

A Collapsed Room~
   This part of the building is almost completely collapsed, leaving it exposed
to the outdoors but still shielded from view by walls that are mostly still
standing. There is a small fire here, as if someone has been living amongst the
ruins.

Inside the Rift~
   The torrential storms look vicious, but little of the rain falls here.
Instead, most of it is being pulled out the rift and into your native plane.
The rain looks more intense further from the rift, so you can't get your
bearings. Even though most of the sun is blocked by storm clouds, the desert
seems brighter here than outside the rift. Every color is more intense. Every
plant seems alive as it clings to the ground against blowing wind. Large,
exposed roots form a loose pathway above the pooling rainwater.

   The pale green plantlife seems to swell as it soaks up every droplet of
water from this rare summer monsoon. But as you look at the cacti and shrubs,
they turn a brighter and brighter shade of green, and seem to swirl with magic.
After all, this is the Magiterranean.

A Torchlit Path~
   Large, tangled roots form a pathway over the puddling water. Bright torches
line the path, somehow untouched by the monsoon rains. Rain is light on the
path, but the droplets that hit you are large and cold. You can't see past the
first line of plants, though, as the monsoon rain forms a wall of water.

A Torchlit Stone Circle~
   The path leads to a circle made from tall stones. The dirt inside the circle
is well-worn, but completely dry. No rain seems to fall inside the circle, but
it's coming down so hard everywhere else that you can barely see anything past
the stones. The root path leads back to the rift from here, and there's also a
small trail leading into the Archweaver's tent.

The Archweaver's Tent~
   You have managed to sneak into the elder mage's tent which, inexplicably, is
larger on the inside. The outside of the tent looked like it was made from
animal hides, but the inside is fine ironwood. Wooden shelves hold piles and
piles of scrolled parchment. There's a writing desk and a wooden trunk, and a
bed made from piled skins. But the rest of the weaver's possessions are piled
haphazardly like a half-mad hoarder.

   The walls are made of dark, rich ironwood. You know this type of wood to be
very heavy, so the sheer amount of it used in building this large tent is
impressive.

A Desert Path~
   The path of overgrown roots twists and winds through the desert, cutting a
dry route through torrential downpour. Indeed, you can barely see past the
first plants, and any attempt to move off the path is met with cold, painful
raindrops.

A Rocky Hilltop~
   The path leads up a small, rocky hill to a vantage point overlooking the
rainy desert. The plants seem to sway like revelers, glad for every drop of
precious water. On the hill, like the root path, the rain is lighter and you
feel only the occasional cold drop.

   This pocket dimension spawns the aggressive cacti for the Monsoon Rift.
This location is not reachable by players. The cacti teleport themselves out on
