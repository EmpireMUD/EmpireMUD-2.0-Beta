Beneath the Hut~
   You find yourself in ankle-deep water beneath the hut. The air is stale
here, filled with swarming insects. It looks like there's a rope ladder hanging
above you, but you can't reach it.

Beneath the Hut~
   You find yourself in ankle-deep water beneath the hut. The air is stale
here, filled with swarming insects. A rope ladder hangs down from the hut above
you, though the scratching at the floorboards make you hesitant to climb up.

rope ladder~
The rope ladder is shabby but should hold your weight.

A Crude Hut, Overlooking the Swamp~
   The hut overlooks the swamp, but it offers no protection from the many
insects that swarm outside. The inside of the hut is a single room, cluttered
with furs that have been turned into crude dolls and furniture made from
strange bones. This is not the sort of place most people would choose to live.
