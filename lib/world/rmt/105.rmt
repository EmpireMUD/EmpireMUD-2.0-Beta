An Interdimensional Whirlwind~
   The air around you spins as if you're trapped in a massive tornado! In the
violent storm, you see glimpses of many worlds -- of home, of the countryside,
and of strange realms beyond the knowledge of mortal men.

A Frozen River~
   Steep glaciers rise up above the edges of the river, which itself has frozen
over completely. Above you, high above the glaciers, the skies are a strange
shade of indigo. It's bright as day and there isn't a cloud in sight, but
there's no sun in the sky and it's at least twenty degrees lower here than
outside the portal. The sparkling sky belies the true nature of this place: you
have found yourself back in the Magiterranean, the secret realm of nature
mages.

The Wall of the Glacier~
   The glaciers lining the river bank rise nearly to the sky, but it is when
you look at their base that you realize this is the same river as outside the
portal. But in this realm, nothing borders it but eternal ice. You must have
entered the Permafrost, one of the most notorious and dangerous realms of the
Magiterranean, where a wary wanderer could find himself frozen to death.

The Base of the Glacier~
   The glacier has cracked open in two places, forming uneven steps up toward
the encampments of the Polar Baron and his icy apprentices. To the South, you
can still see the portal out of this forsaken place. The glacier shakes around
you, threatening to collapse at any second. But for now, at least, it seems to
be holding.

A Rising Path up the Glacier~
   The treacherous path up the glacier climbs steeply, rarely leveling off long
enough for a break. The path is winding, and the only thing you can see besides
the ice walls is the indigo sky above.

A Rising Path up the Glacier~
   As you ascend the glacier, the path begins to level out. The walls are still
steep, but you must be approaching the top. A small trickle of meltwater has
begun to wash away the stairs you are climbing, and you realize this glacier
may not last.

An Outcropping at the Top~
   You have reached the top of the glacier, though the path doesn't end here.
Now that you have a clear view of the countryside, you see it is far different
than you remember it on the outside of the portal. Frost covers every treetop
that pokes out from the endless sea of rolling snow.

A Path Through Deep Snow~
   The path along the top of the glacier leads you into thick, light snow,
which looks as if it must just have fallen, though the sky is clear. The path
has been cut just wide enough to walk in single file and it winds through the
deep snow so that you can hardly tell what's ahead. A steady stream of
meltwater runs along the path, giving you cause to think the glacier has
already begun to melt.

   The twisting staircase of ice leads you on a dangerous path up the glacier.
You hear the howl of strange animals, punctuated by louder howls from the
fierce winds that threaten to tear you from the path.

A Rising Path up the Glacier~
   You come to a narrow ledge, with only the cold iron handgrips that have been
drilled into the glacier for stability. As you turn the corner on the ledge,
the platform widens only slightly, before leading to another staircase.

A Small Cave at the Top~
   The staircase ends at a small cave, which quickly proves to be a tunnel as
it exits onto the top of the glacier. In the center of the cave, a violet fire
burns atop blue logs of ice. No heat seems to come from the fire -- at least,
none that you can feel.

been placed in such a way as to provide a steady path through it. You still
seem to be at the top of the glacier, although you can't see the sky from here.

Atop a Frozen Altar~
   The path leads up to an enormous altar made entirely of ice. As you ascend
its steps, you realize you can see the entire realm from here. It looks so
similar to the world outside the portal, despite being covered in glaciers and
a sea of snow. Torches of cold, violet fire illuminate the entire altar, and
cast eerie shadows that are, somehow, colder than the ice.
