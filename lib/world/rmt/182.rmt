Aboard a Great Tortoise~
   The massive tortoise has a tiered boardwalk haphazardly nailed to its shell,
with steps leading up to a building. The colossal chelonian beneath your feet
plods so slowly across the land that its shell has overgrown with moss and
shrubs. Still, you can see most of the countryside from here.

Inside the Tavern~
   The walls of the Tipsy Tortoise are heavily patched and worn, but are
decorated with trophies of all manner of animals, as well as several unusual
portraits. The tavern shakes back and forth as the tortoise walks, but the sway
of the building actually makes for a more comfortable ride than on the shell.

E
walls mahogany~
   The walls appear to have been made of rich, red, straight-grained mahogany.
But the tortoise's powerful footsteps, which shake the walls even as you
examine them, have forced many repairs with many types of wood, probably
locally sourced from wherever the tavern happened to be. You can find parts of
the walls patched with everything from oak and maple, to ebony and magi-nolia.
~
E
trophies trophy heads animals~
   The wall is lined with the heads of strange beasts, most of them held up
only by a ring of iron nails. Several of the trophies are damaged, probably
from being jostled off their mounts. Each beast has its name painted above and
below it, in different languages. The labels read Griffin, Chimera, Minotaur,
Unicorn, Medusa, Giant Scorpion, Phoenix, and Dracosaur.
~
E
griffin~
   The griffin's head looks like it's been knocked off the wall a few times,
and the beak has come loose to reveal that this is actually a lion.
~
E
chimera~
   Where there were once three plaques with the chimera's heads, only a large
goat head remains.
~
E
minotaur~
Upon closer inspection, this is a bull's head.
~
E
unicorn~
   This unicorn, while certainly majestic, actually appears to be a horse with
a narwhal horn attached to its forehead -- which, when you think about it, is
still fairly impressive.
~
E
medusa~
   The 'Medusa' label is over an opaque screen, with only the shadow of a
nebulous figure cast upon it by a flickering candle. You can see how it might
be the shadow of a head with snakes coming out of it. Or perhaps a small bush.
~
E
scorpion giant~
   You approach the alcove labeled 'Giant Scorpion' but find there's a plate of
curved glass in front of it that, upon closer inspection, is magnifying a
perfectly ordinary scorpion.
~
E
phoenix~
It's too badly damaged to figure out what it is.
~
E
dracosaur~
Upon closer inspection, this is just a regular dragon.

The Viewing Platform~
   A wooden ramp slopes gently up from the inside of the tavern to this
platform, built out over the head of the tortoise, which provides a beautiful
view of the surrounding land as, down below, the tortoise moves.

The Back Room~
   This appears to have been someone's office at one time, but the bookshelves
are empty and there is no sign of a desk. Instead, a wrestling mat covers much
of the room and people are placing bets in the corner.

   All of the furniture has been cleared out of the back room, except the
bookshelves, which are attached. The floor is padded with a wrestling mat,
which makes this one of the least-nauseating places in the tavern. Closer
inspection of the bookshelves reveals the names of various champions carved
into the dried old mahogany.

The Tipsy Tortoise Giftshop~
   The giftshop is little more than an alcove behind a table and some
barstools, but there are some interesting items on the shelf. However, a sign
on the wall clearly says 'Adventurers Only'.

A Spiral Staircase~
   A narrow staircase in the corner of the Tipsy Tortoise leads you up to a
small second-floor landing, with a door leading toward the back of the
tortoise. A large golden plaque declares this the headquarters of the Guild of
Adventurers.

The Guild of Adventurers~
   The lobby of the guildhall is surprisingly well-kept compared to the rustic
Tipsy Tortoise downstairs. The walls are made of fine stained cherry wood, and
are covered in exotic trophies of all types. Overstuffed chairs encircle a
strange firepit in the center of the room.

overstuffed chairs firepit pit~
   The firepit contains a lively white flame which seems to neither crackle nor
smoke. The room is not vented, but it also isn't overly warm. The chairs are
arranged around it in a way that makes you want to sit and tell a great story.
~
E
trophies trophy walls heads~
   The walls are covered in rich cherry wood, and trimmed in dark ironwood that
has been carved to depict tiny adventure scenes. The walls are adorned with
trophies including a selection of exotic horns, a manticore's tail, a row of
giant scorpions, a griffin's pelt, and a dracosaur tail.
~
E
exotic horns~
   This wall is covered in the horns of various animals, each on a plaque with
the animal's name and who defeated it. The horns include a dragon, a unicorn, a
dracosaur, and a demon-goat.
~
E
manticore's tail~
The three-pronged tail of a manticore has been mounted over the door.
~
E
giant scorpions~
   The giant scorpions range in size from the size of your hand to the size of
your arm!
~
E
griffin's pelt~
The griffin's pelt is huge, and covers most of one wall.
~
E
dracosaur tail~
   The long tail of a massive dracosaur is mounted on one wall, and on part of
the wall next to it.

The Alchemy Alcove~
   Tucked into an alcove off of the guildhall's lobby you find a full
alchemist's workbench and study. A shelf of books, indexed by herb, takes up
much of the space in the alcove. Locked display cases show a variety of potions
in various shades of red.

   The shadows nearly obscure this alcove off of the lobby. As you approach it,
a plush sofa and a strange fountain appear, as well as walls covered in arcane
tomes. A black carpet across the floor seems to undulate in a nonexistent
breeze.

A Noisy Loft~
   You climb up into the loft, which has been converted into a mechanical
workshop. Clockwork arms, legs, wings, and other parts you can't identify are
strewn about the cramped corners. Exotic weapons sit on several workbenches, as
well as strange, oversized rings.
