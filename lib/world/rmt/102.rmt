A Goblin Nest~
   The floor of the ruins is eaten away and you stumble down into a den to
which the word filthy hardly does justice. It looks like several goblins have
made their home here, and it may be difficult to get them to leave.

nest filth~
The nest is made primarily from bits of litter and the bones of food.

A Little Garden~
   You've stumbled across a little garden hidden behind a row of plants. It's
just a little plot, but it's obvious someone has taken good care of it. Neat
rows of dirt have been carefully watered and though you can't see what's
growing in them, the fertile soil is sure to produce something delicious.

The Hidden Garden~
   The druid's tiny garden has changed somehow. The air is thick and fills your
lungs, although its strange fragrance is totally unknown to you. The landscape
in the distance is blurry, as if the air is waving and blocking your view. And
then you realize what has happened: you have stumbled back into the
Magiterranean, the hidden realm of druids.

The Cactus Garden~
   This Magiterranean cactus garden is expansive, but each of its cacti looks
the same. These are prickly pear cacti, arranged as bushes of round, spined
pads. Pale yellow flowers and bright red fruits poke out from the tops of the
upper pads on each plant.

A Pineapple Field~
   Long rows of short pineapple plants run the length of the field, in soil so
fertile that it is dark black in color. The pineapples give off a sweet scent,
and many of them appear to be ripe. On others, the bright red spiral flower
atop each plant merely hints at the sweet beauty of the fruit that will grow
out of it.

An Agave Field~
   The Magiterranean is the perfect environment for growing any plant, and even
the desert-loving agave thrives here. The field is dotten with small piles of
stones, each with a pale green agave plant atop it. The agaves grow thick,
fleshy leaves before sprouting a huge stalk into the air to spread its seeds.
The heart of the agave is a prized food in some cultures.

An Aloe Garden~
   The aloe garden is covered in dozens of small, green, succulent aloe plants.
Each is spaced far enough that you can comfortably work at it, which makes it
easier not to get stuck on the sharp, fleshy leaves. Aloe has long been used to
soothe the skin and treat painful wounds. Perhaps that's what the druids of the
Magiterranean are growing it for.

Base Camp~
   A ring of tents encircled by blue-flamed torches seems to be all that
protects the portal from a towering, leafy, primeval jungle. Boxes of supplies
have been moved here for what appears to be a long hunting expedition, although
you're not quite sure what they're hunting for.

A Clearing in the Primeval Forest~
   You come to a clearing in the primeval forest, where the dense tangle of
vines and underbrush opens up to reveal a magnificent landscape. A volcano
thunders on the horizon, spewing smoke and ash into the air and darkening the
sun. Through the jungle, you can hear hundreds of animals roar back in
response.

Backtracking Toward Camp~
   You try your best to follow the trail back towards base camp and, though you
get turned around several times, you eventually find the torch-lit path. The
light from the torches flickers an eerie shade of violet, perhaps enchanted to
keep the dracosaurs at bay.
