The Grand Foyer of the Tower Skycleave~
   The tremendous entrance hall is lavishly appointed with ebony-paneled walls,
polished flagstone floors, and velvet curtains that flank the high windows. The
ceiling rises impossibly high above you, giving the impression that the foyer
is as large as the entirety of the tower.
   The room's centerpiece is a lifesize statue of a sorcerer carved in striped
wood, his hand outstretched as if to welcome you. Across the foyer, Grand High
Sorcerer Knezz watches you from an oversized portrait near the black double
doors of the entrance.

statue striped centerpiece~
   The statue is lifesize and rather lifelike, of a sorcerer pontificating with
his hand held out, draped in robes that give the impression of flowing fabric
even as they are made from solid wood. The wood itself is striped black and
brown, made from rare calamander. At the base, a nocturnium plate reads:

                 +-------------------------------------+
                 |    Integrity  -  Honor  -  Power    |

   The portrait of Grand High Sorcerer Knezz is downright gigantic. Indeed, it
is painted from a low angle, with a great deal of space devoted to his long
salt-and-pepper gray beard, decorated with nocturnium beads. His bushy eyebrows
rest atop thick crescent glasses; his large blue eyes look at you with an
almost fatherly gaze.

The Central Chamber of the Tower Skycleave~
   The vast central chamber of the Tower Skycleave stretches up above, where
you can see the second floor railing, which is covered in giant leaves and
vines. Directly above you, the bottom of the ever-spiraling walkway forms a
circular rim around the inside of the chamber through which a magnificent
nocturnium tree reaches down. The chamber looks cluttered -- perhaps the
sorcerers are redecorating. Or, perhaps the scorch marks on the marble floor
portend something more sinister.

The Second Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The ebony paneled wall of the curving walkway is decorated with portraits of
the Tower Skycleave's old masters, with broken nocturnium light fixtures
seperated evenly to either side of each portrait. Several of the portraits are
crooked or fallen from the walls that also bear scorch and claw marks.
   Unsettling and ominous sounds and shrieks echo through the chamber while a
sturdy door hangs partially from its hinges. A yellow sign with red lettering
has been splintered and hangs from the top of the doorway. To the northeast,
vines and plants have grown over the walkway; you'll have to find a way past.

   Abaris's portrait hangs askew, part of its ebony frame cracked. He is
portrayed as a middle-aged man in sepia robes, holding a simple wooden staff,
standing in front of a modest sorcery tower made from white clay bricks.

salt-and-pepper hair and beard. His portrait shows him in a black robe with a
crooked wand, standing in front of a tall tower built from cyclopean stone.

   Grand High Sorcerer Fural's portrait is crooked. Fural is a short woman with
pale, almost gray skin. Her earlobes are stretched to great size by discs made
of iridescent abalone shell. Her hair is gray-white and braided back. Her robes
are deep purple and many-layered. Her staff is rough wood with a green gem,
perhaps jade, on the end. A mustache has been drawn on her face in crude
charcoal. The nameplate is missing from the bottom of the portrait.

A Most Peculiar Maze~
   A mass of glowing vines undulates about the room, pierced by an arching
rainbow. It moves about randomly to make footing treacherous. Small but
numerous saplings have sprung up throughout the area to further make progress
difficult. Along the arching rainbow stretching across the room, twisting
through the tops of saplings and vines, is a collection of pixies that appear
to be line dancing. Everywhere you look is the same baffling assortment of
unnatural flora; you can't even tell what part of the tower you're in.

The Goblin Cages~
   Set around the perimeter of the dim room are large cages. Not only have most
been opened, but some seem to have had the door completely ripped off. A large
ring set into the floor in the center has been left mostly untouched while a
desk off in one corner has been flipped over and papers are scattered every-
where. The window is half boarded-over and with the lamp on the ground, shadows
populate the empty cages.

most of them are fouled and you can't make out much. One sticky sheet is still
partially legible:

       ... why the goblins keep trying to get in. Seems fruitless;
       they just end up in cages. Perhaps they've heard we have some
       old goblin knickknacks lying around? Still, seems foolish to
       risk it all for bits of jade. Have never known a goblin to
       stick its green neck out for treasure, though. They value
       their hides more than that.

could be squeezed into it. As you close in to get a good look at this bin, a
powerful stench overwhelms you. Before you are forced to back away, however,
you see that it seems to be of one piece with the wall behind it. There are
unusual scrapes along the floor next to it. Perhaps if you search around, you

continue up to the third floor. The line of damaged portraits depicting the

   The stairs here rise toward the third floor. You can see they've been
barricaded at the top.
~
E
railing rails handrail~
   The curving walkway is guarded by an ebony handrail that keeps you from
falling. Over the railing, just out of reach, is an immense chandelier shaped
like an upside-down tree.
~
E
chandelier tree up upside-down~
   An incredible nocturnium tree hangs down from the very top of the tower,
reaching nearly to the fountain below with its spindly black branches. Each
branch bears a small oil lamp, lighting the entire central chamber like a
thousand twinkling stars.
~
E
chamber central room~
   The central chamber of the tower is an enormous cylinder with the ever-
spiraling walkway climbing its round ebony wall. A nocturnium chandelier in the
shape of a full-size, upside-down tree hangs down from the top of the tower
down to the first floor. There are no windows in the chamber, as it runs up the
tower's core.
   Most of this floor is overgrown with vines, saplings, and dense jungle
foliage. From here, it's hard to see the way through.
~
E
fountain down~
Far below, you can see the enormous fountain at the center of the first floor.
~
E
ebony wood~
   Virtually everything on this floor, from the floors, to the railings, to the
wall are all made from black ebony, though it's not in good condition.
~
E
nocturnium~
   Every metal accent and sculpture here, including the enormous chandelier, is
made from pitch black nocturnium.
~
E
lights fixtures~
   In addition to the many hundreds of lights on the great chandelier, there
are smaller light fixtures on the wall between the portraits of the old masters
of the tower.
~
E
portraits paintings masters~
   The ebony-framed portraits that line the long curve of the second floor
hallway end here with Knezz, Kofi, and Wong, all of which have been damaged
by the mercenaries.
~
E
Wong~
   The portrait of Grand High Sorcerer Wong, hanging askew and with part of
the ebony frame missing, shows a heavy man wrapped in violet and gray robes,
with short-cropped hair under a tall conical hat. He is shown next to the Tower
Skycleave with his arms crossed. Beneath his painting, the nameplate reads:
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 |       Grand High Sorcerer Wong       |
                 |    Great Builder, Passed Naturally   |
                 +--------------------------------------+
~
E
Kofi~
   Grand High Sorcerer Kofi's painting is torn at the bottom and his eyes
have been scribbled out with black charcoal. He is painted wearing a draping,
violet and white striped cloth over purple robes. On his head, he wears a
small, round hat, also in purple, stitched with gold and nocturnium. His skin
is a deep, rich brown color with chiseled features. Below his portrait, the
nameplate reads:
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 |       Grand High Sorcerer Kofi       |
                 |   Master of Glass, +-----------------+
                 +--------------------+
~
E
knezz~
   The portrait of Knezz is the last one in line at the base of the stairs,
though it now hangs, askew, by a nail through one eye. His image shows him in
his most familiar pose as he stands meditating outdoors in his violet and gold
robes. He looks younger in the portrait, which is painted from a low angle so
as to make him look almost like a giant next to the tower. The nameplate below
his portrait reads:
                 +-----------------+
                 |      Grand High +-------------------+
                 |            Master of Time           |

A Most Peculiar Maze~
   A mass of glowing vines undulates about the room, pierced by an arching
rainbow. It moves about randomly to make footing treacherous. Small but
numerous saplings have sprung up throughout the area to further make progress
difficult. Along the arching rainbow stretching across the room, twisting
through the tops of saplings and vines, is a collection of pixies that appear
to be hula dancing. Everywhere you look is the same baffling assortment of
unnatural flora; you can't even tell what part of the tower you're in.

The Third Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   Scorch-marks splatter the violet tile floor just above the floating stair-
case. Together with the splintered ebony panels of the curving wall, it paints
a violent picture of the battle that must have happened here. There is also a
shield dangling by its strap from the enormous nocturnium tree chandelier that
hangs in the center of the great chamber. Things are not good on this floor.

It's just an expression; there's no picture here.
~
E
staircases stairs steps floating~
   The staircases -- both here and across the central chamber at the other end
of the third floor -- have their steps attached only to the chamber's curving
wall; they look like they're floating!
   The steps below you are made from black ebony wood -- like almost everything
in the immense chamber. They're guarded only by a sleek wooden handrail. And a
careless person could easily slip through.

Across the ebony handrail, there's a shield stuck in the chandelier.

   The entire core of the Tower Skycleave is one immense chamber, a column from

   The wide tile walkway climbs the tower in a long spiral, interrupted here
and there by staircases. At every point other than where you're standing, the
walkway looks sloped. Here, it's perfectly flat.
   There's a surprising amount of furniture on the walkway, much of it over-
turned, but it's not clear where it all came from. Doors line the ebony walls,
though most are locked shut.

   There are a lot of chairs and tables. Some of them are overturned; others
are blocking doors. Still others have just been pushed aside.

   Most of the chamber is lit by a single enormous chandelier in the shape of
an inverted black tree that seems to grow down from the top of the tower. The
whole thing is sculpted from twisting, turning nocturnium wire, from trunk to
branch. And on uncountable thousands of its branches there are tiny oil lamps
that, all together, light every corner of the chamber.
   A shield is dangling by its strap from one of the branches.

The Third Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   This floor of the Tower Skycleave seems to have housed the tower's most
advanced students, but now houses intruders to the tower instead. Along the
walkway, the armchairs and tables that would have been a decadent social space
have been repurposed as barricades or left to smoulder. Most of the doors that
line the round central chamber are closed, locked, and warded. One large door
is cracked open, however; an enchanting little sign hangs over it.

permutations, from teacup to kettle to pot to potroast to porcupine to beaver
to tree to leaves to tea and, at long last, back to teacup. Then it runs
through a new sequence, then another, all the while the deep blue background
color and elegant silver writing never change. It simply says:

part of the handrail missing. Someone has snapped a branch off of the great
nocturnium chandelier and stabbed it through one of the ebony wall panels. As
if to add insult to injury, the painting next to the door depicts a woman on

the midnight-blue starry background and the woman's blue velvet robe. The

   The acrid smoke in the air takes on a new, fouler odor as you approach a
door with an ichor-green sign dangling precariously over it. Eerie green flames
spit the occasional spark from a pair of modified nocturnium light fixtures
flanking the putrid door. Most of the other doors on this floor are locked and

increasingly made of marble until, at the top, the ceramic steps are finished
and only marble remains.
   The staircases -- both here and across the central chamber at the other end
of the third floor -- have their steps attached only to the chamber's curving
wall; they look like they're floating!

   The entire core of the Tower Skycleave is one immense chamber, a column from
the ground floor to the top. The middle has an incredible inverted tree whose
branches light the never-ending walkway and staircases that spiral up the
chamber walls.

   The wide tile walkway climbs the tower in a long spiral, interrupted here

walkway looks sloped. Here, where it meets the stairs, it's perfectly flat.

E

   You can see many doors along the third floor walkway, but most are closed
and many have shimmering protective wards, like columns of light blocking all
entry.

E
chandelier tree upside-down inverted lamps lights~
   The enormous inverted tree of a chandelier is mostly below you now; you've
reached the part where the trunk meets the crown and above you, it's only
trunk. The tree is made entirely of twisted nocturnium wire, untwisting below
you to create the branches that hold thousands of tiny lamps.

   Most of the tower's accents, door handles, and even the chandelier are made
from matte black nocturnium metal.

The Eruditorium~
   This large chamber is mostly empty, save for a heavily-constructed platform
in the center of the marble floor. Thick, faintly glowing chains are bolted to
the surface of the platform. The paneled walls have dents and cracks along them
and some of the light fixtures are bent out of shape. Clay pots lay broken
about the room, some smashed well beyond recognition. You can see some cabinets
through a small archway on the south wall.

   The platform is part of the floor, but raised several inches above it.
Chains with massive bolts are attached to the outside of the platform. They
would probably secure most anything locked up with them as they glow a sickly
green color. As an extra precaution, a strange script has been written, carved,
embedded -- or maybe it's just there -- in many places of the platform. It
is difficult to get a true look at the script, but it too glows that same odd
green color.

The Experimentation Chamber~
   The cold stone walls pour icy mist that pools on the floor. Work benches
along one wall are covered in odd tools and arcane implements. When you turn
back toward the door, you see broken caskets leaning against the wall beside
it. Locked chests under the work benches seem to rattle and shake on their own,
hidden from what little light spills from the lamp fixtures set high on the
wall. The chamber has one window, but it's boarded over. A stone table in the
center of the chamber has leather straps and no small number of stains.

   There is a distinct border to this strange wall. It has a slight waver to it
which disturbs the pattern of light when you look at it just right. Centered in
the wavering area is an unusual painting.
~
E
painting picture bagel visuals~
You examine the painting on the wavering wall:
   The upper section of this painting is three people standing around a platter
made of a silvery metal. The first man looks like a disapproving old mentor.
The middle lady has a contemplative look on her face. The last man has a slight
smile as he examines the bagel sitting atop the platter. The one thing common
to all three people is the fact that it seems like they are all slightly
drooling. The bagel itself is sliced cleanly into an upper and lower half with
the upper half set askew to expose the fluffy inside. The top of the bagel is
sprinkled with seeds, flakes, and a fine greenish-white dust. Set beside it are
small tubs of various condiments. At the bottom, the nameplate says:

   It looks as though someone, once upon a time, attempted to keep this pile of
toasters, brooms, mops, cups, pots, pans, and other various household items in
some sort of order. The efforts of that person have served well to create a
foundation for the other haphazardly stacked and thrown items in this corner of

there is little room to walk between worktables, shelves, and prototypes of all

   While all the worktables look similar, they each seem to deal in a different

a magineer. The strange apparatuses above each table are even more confusing.
Some have dangling tubes that seem to writhe, leading to strangely-designed
tools, each different and hard to look at. Disconcerting noises come from each
apparatus on the walls, combining with voices and other sounds to make a
horrendous cacophony.

Sorcerer's office. To the southwest, it slopes downward toward the stairs. But
just here, where you're standing, the floor seems perfectly flat.
   The walkway here is covered in fallen books, an unhinged door, several

archway behind her exposes a workshop with a mob of household items all
clattering their way through it. Brooms, candlesticks, buckets, floating rugs,
and even a desk are making their way to the portal and seem to be in hot
pursuit of the young woman. Text at the bottom reads:

   This most luxurious set of rooms in the tower stands out from all others.
With doors leading off to private rooms and bespoke pieces of calamander
furniture, it is a thing most wouldn't ever understand. The walls of stellar
magewood reflect the light from an ever-changing chandelier which seems to just
hang in mid-air. Rugs so plush and thick they could be used as beds themselves
cover most of the alternating white and black marble flooring. Several

of the path is the same in the entire garden.

   Each sculpture is created from a different shade of stone. They are all

   Every topiary shrub and bush in the garden is formed into the shape of
animals and fantastical beasts of all kinds, from ones the size of a loaf of

the shrubs they seem to be in a slightly different position than before and you
could almost swear that you can see them move if you watch, though they seem

   The collar where the branch meets the tree trunk is so enormous that you
can't scale it even with the grooved texture of the bark. The branch stretches
so far into the haze that you can't see the end. At its edge, near the trunk, a

all made from many colors of stone.

The Great Tree, Atop the Glimmering Stair~
   Words can do little justice to the elegance of this staircase, which
descends in a tremendous spiral around the great tree. Its blocks are hewn from
stones of every color, built like masonry but on a scale you have never seen.
Looking over the edge, you see the steps spiral further down than you can see,
as everything below fades into mist. Above you, the tree reaches forever
upwards, cleaving the sky with its mighty branches.

   Each block of the staircase is cut from brilliant stone in violet, blue,
green, yellow, orange, red, and every color in between. From here, you can see
thousands of hand-cut blocks, but surely a staircase of this size is made from
so, so many more than that. The blocks are no larger than a standard brick,
stacked without mortar but perfectly stable. As you stomp your foot to test the
sturdiness for yourself, you forget for a moment that all of this is built onto
the side of a tree. There are broken pieces of ladder on the steps.

E
tree trunk~
   The enormous tree reaches up toward the infinite sky. The girth of the tree
is such that you cannot see the entire trunk as the sides curve out of view.
That is to say, the tree is even larger than it looks from here. The parts you
can see are mostly covered in large lichens in every shade from pale green to
bright yellow. Very little of the bark is visible through the lichen crust.
~

   Looking over the sides, the tree descends as far as you can see -- and then
fades into the mist below. Glimmering stone buildings jut out from the stairs
all the way, far too numerous to count, and their flickering torches shine up
through the haze, suggesting perhaps thousands of people live on this strange
structure. The highest building, in the shape of a giant seashell, emits a soft

   The entire surface of the seashell -- every curve, ridge, and whorl -- has

~
E
stairs staircase many-colored stones steps~
   The staircase is built from small blocks of brightly-colored stone. In some
places, the stones are arranged to form patterns that remind you of lillies and
orchids. In others, the colors of the stones seem less intentional, perhaps
from repair work. Indeed, many parts of the staircase seem to have been
repaired recently.
~
E
palace obsidian shining north~
   From the stairs, you have a spectacular view of the obsidian palace. Its
glossy black surface reflects every one of the colorful stones of the
staircase, giving the palace the appearance of a magnificent rainbow crossing
its round, inky facade. The palace is three stories tall -- spectacular in its
own right, but absolutely dwarfed by the tree or the staircase.
~
E
tree trunk~
   The great tree is beyond description, stretching both up and down farther
than you can see. Indeed, you can't even see the sides, as they curve away into
the mist. Most of the bark is encrusted with giant lichens in several shades of
green and yellow. Where there are no lichens, it's because pieces of bark have
fallen off, revealing dry, porous wood beneath.

   The colorful stairs and buildings reflect off the haze that hangs in the

The Obsidian Palace of Smol Nes-Pik~
   The opulence of the grand rotunda has you in awe. Every wall sconce, every
pillar, every chair, every ornament, spangle or bauble is carved from the same
single shard of obsidian -- and it must have been enormous. The chamber rises
in long, sweeping steps toward the obsidian throne at the highest level. The
ceiling dangles pendulously above you, cut to look like cascading chandeliers,
with each facet of the black glass reflecting dozens of oil lamps. Below,
stairs lead down to the dew pools, which shimmer just as majestically as they
reflect the lamplight back up.

rotunda palace room obsidian~
   The entire palace is cut from one enormous shard of obsidian, a black glass
found in volcanic fields. Most of the obsidian you've seen is so small it's
only suited to handaxes and spear points. To sculpt a palace out of a piece
this large, it must have taken thousands of artisans and uncountable hours.
Surely nothing else like this exists, anywhere. Each and every detail has been
sculpted from the same obsidian core, never separated.
~
E
sconces oil lamps~
   The sconces are carved in relief from the very walls of the obsidian palace.
Each one has an oil reservoir and a wick rest, with a bright white flame atop
it. Dozens of these lamps cast the light all around the great chamber,
glimmering off the ceiling, the walls, and the dew pools down below.

The fluted pillars are cut directly from the obsidian of the palace.
~
E
chairs~
   There are chairs on the sides of the long, arching steps. It seems most
people are meant to stand or kneel on the steps directly, so perhaps the chairs
are here for courtesans and appellants who are too frail to kneel. Each chair
is carved from the very obsidian of the palace, in deep relief. Curiously, none
of the chairs have backs, but each and every one of them has two armrests.
~
E

   The walls are richly ornamented with flowers, fruits, nuts, and insects, all
sculpted in relief from the obsidian palace itself.
~
E

   Where the walls of the palace aren't ornamented with the shapes of fruits
and flowers, it's highly textured with glittering little spangles that look, at
first glance, like they must have been stuck onto the walls. But on closer
inspection, each and every one of them is carved in relief from the walls
themselves, still attached, made from the same single continuous piece of
obsidian as the enter palace.
~
E
steps stairs staircase~
   The steps form long semi-circles across the width of the round chamber.
Although the steps are uneven, they have enough room for rows of people to
stand or kneel along each of them. Near the walls, most of the great steps
feature chairs, always facing toward the throne at the top. The entire room is
stepped, from the base at the entrance to the throne on the highest level.
Near the entrance, two smaller staircases descend toward the dew pools, with
hand railings carved from the same single piece of obsidian as everything in
the palace.
~
E
ceiling up chandeliers~
   The ceiling hangs high above you, with pendulous sculptures that emerge from
the inky heights to reflect the flickering lamplight of the palace. Each
sculpture branches and forks, both giving the impression of the roots of a
tree, and also fragmenting the lamplight to mimic thousands of tiny stars all
twinkling overhead.
~
E
throne~
   The throne has a rougher, more natural cut than most of the palace. It
emerges from the highest of the long, arching steps that lead from the doorway
to the top of the great, round chamber. The throne has no back, only a wide
bench and two armrests. Its broad, crude facets lack the highly-polished
character of the rest of the palace, and have a milky gray color rather than
the glimmering lamplight reflections that shine off of most of the surfaces
like little stars.

pools reflecting lamplight back up at you.

stump, there is an endless sea of calm, still water. Above, the full moon hangs
in the cloudless sky.

trunk stump tree decay wood~
   Whole castles could be built on top of this stump, if not for the rot that
causes it to crumble beneath your feet. Could this be the same great tree as
before? Something disastrous has happened to it!
~
E
sea calm endless water ocean~
   The sea is perfectly calm as it reaches out toward the horizon in all
dimensions. There's no hint of land to be found, not even clouds on the
horizon. Glints of violet, green, and blue light can be seen deep beneath the
surface of the water around the tree, but you cannot tell what they're coming
from.

E
sky moon full up cloudless~
   The full moon, brighter than you've ever seen, hangs in the sky as if on a
silver thread, splitting the sky in two. Beyond the moon, few stars twinkle as
most are drowned in the stunning moonlight.

stars~
You can't see very many stars. The moon is too bright.

E
shadow~
   Iskip's shadow has a reddish-orange hue not unlike a blood moon, and it
seems to be animated all on its own. It stretches too far into the distance for
you to see the entire thing, so there's no telling what nefarious business it's
up to.

The Royal Chambers~
   The obsidian stairs lead up to a series of chambers separated only by
archways, at once seeming to be both separate rooms and one enormous room.
Small, cozy beds occupy most of these rooms, but the one furthest back holds a
grand canopy bed furnished all in gold. Like the rest of the palace, the
obsidian walls, floor, and ceiling have been meticulously carved with the
shapes of flowers and trees.

E
obsidian palace~
   The entire palace is sculpted from the largest piece of obsidian you have
ever seen. The semi-translucent glass of the walls sparkles with the dots of
color from the glimmering staircase outside, forming a rainbow that brings the
only color to the room.
~
E
stairs staircase steps~
   The stairs are cut into the single tower of obsidian that makes up every
part of this palace. They are steep, following the curve of the palace wall
down to the main chamber.
~
E
beds canopy~
   Most of the beds are small and simple, and a quick touch reveals they are
probably stuffed with straw or grass. But at the back of the chamber, beyond
the largest archway, a grand canopy bed rises from the floor. Its posts are
carved from the very obsidian of the palace, and though you don't dare touch
the bed, it looks much softer than the rest.
~
E
walls floor ceiling carved carvings flowers~
   Every inch of the obsidian, from the floor to the ceiling, has been carved
to resemble trees, leaves, flowers, buds, and roots.

Trapped in a Jar~
   You find yourself inside a giant jar! The clay walls are cool to the touch
and far too thick to break. High above you, the light glints off of the blue
wax that seals the jar. It seems you're well and truly trapped.

E
jar clay walls~
   The steep, curving walls of the jar are made from unglazed red clay. As you
bang on them, the dull echo reveals that they are very thick. Your weapon dulls
as you bash it against the sides without leaving a single mark. There's no way
out... This is REALLY A NIGHTMARE!
~
E
blue wax seal~
   The wax above you is uneven with the ripples it formed as it settled and
cooled. It looks like there might be an imprint on the top side of the seal,
but the wax is too thick to make out the shape from this side. You can barely
reach the wax, but nothing in your power seems to damage it. This is like a bad
dream you can't WAKE UP from.
~
E
light glints~
   You can't see where the light is coming from, but every surface of the
inside of the jar is well-lit. It's almost like a dream -- if only you could
WAKE UP.

Rot and Ruin~
   You are entombed in the putrid sap of the Great Tree, frozen, able to do
nothing more than watch and witness as the tree dies.
