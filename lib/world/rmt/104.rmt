A Burning Hamlet~
   The sky over the small hamlet is thick with smoke, and some of the buildings
nearby are already half-burnt. It looks like all sane citizens have fled, but
no small number of them did not make it out the gates.

Market Street~
   The street, once dense with market stalls, now lies in total disarray.
Charred fruit rolls slowly down the hillside, amidst the trampled remains of
flower bouquets and spoiled vegetables.

Market Street~
   The chaos of the burning hamlet has left piles of rubble and spilled goods
down the entire length of Market Street. The buildings that line the street
have been boarded up, probably by desperate citizens hoping to save their
homes.

The Market Street Blockade~
   At the intersection where Market Street meets Trade Row, the hamlet's
citizens have constructed a huge blockade. The street is completely impassable.
But at least the buildings aren't on fire here.

A Back Alley~
   The alley stretches behind Market Street's buildings, though crowded by a
tall fence on the back side. The alley looks like it will get you around to the
town square, but there isn't much room to move back here.

A Back Alley~
   The alley comes to an end behind town square, past the burning blockade.
From here you can see the square, which looks like it's being torn up by a huge
animal. For the moment, though, you're safe here.

The West End of Town Square~
   You have reached the town square -- or what's left of it. It looks like the
skeletal mammoth has torn up carts, stalls, and building facades alike. Every
street is blocked by the devastation, and burning buildings prevent you from
going any direction except back into the alley.

Main Street~
   The shop fronts of Main Street are boarded up and the less fortunate among
them are actually on fire. Melted plates of slag adorn the front of the
armorer's old shop, and most of the citizens appear to have fled.

Main Street~
   Main Street curves around a small hillside which is now completely on fire.
Several buildings have completely collapsed amidst the chaos, and you can hear
the howling of the undead from every dark corner.

The Main Street Blockade~
   Main Street is completely blocked at Trade Row, which normally links Main
Street to Market Street. It seems that some desperate town guards must have
tried to block the necromancers from advancing into the hamlet.

A Half-Demolished Store~
   You've found your way through the rubble and into a store whose frame is
still standing. Most of its walls are in ruins, letting you cut through the
store to get past the Main Street blockade.

Main Street~
   You have made your way past the blockade and toward Town Square, but the
howling of demons and the shouts of necromancers drowns out even the roar of
the burning buildings. The blockade to the south blocks you from leaving the
city, although you can still cut through the shop again.

The East End of Town Square~
   Town Square is cut in half by toppled wagons and mountains of debris. In the
streets, there are corpses of citizens who appear to have been killed, raised
as undead, and killed again. The sky is dark with smoke, but it looks like
every path out of the square is blocked.

Temple Street~
   The cobblestone street winds up the hillside toward the temple that
overlooks the small hamlet. Compared to the rest of the town, this area is
relatively undamaged. Still, it looks like the citizens have all fled.

The Entrance to the Temple~
   You have reached the front of the hamlet's new temple which would have been
grand, if it weren't already on fire. The necromancers seem to have ignited the
marble itself, and the building looks as if it is slowly melting.

The Ruined Temple~
   This temple, though dedicated only last week, is already in ruins. The
oculus in the ceiling has opened completely and chunks of burning marble lie
where statues once stood. The smoke over the city has begun to clear and you
can clearly see all of the hamlet from the windows. Unfortunately, it's now
clear that no part of this town can be saved.

   The pungent smell of waste weighs heavily in the air despite the dried-up
trough that runs the length of the sewer. Goblins have blocked up this portion
of the tunnels, although they hardly smell better than the city refuse.

matted rat fur to make room for a grand throne -- at least, to the goblins. It
appears some ambitious goblin has set up a command post here. Perhaps they're
planning an invasion?
