A Portal in the Fog~
   You find yourself in a thick bank of fog which has nestled itself into an
eerie grove. The trees are not dense, but their thick canopy drowns out the
sun, except for a few stray rays. The fog keeps you from seeing more than fifty
feet in any direction, and the call of animals tells you that you are not
alone. You can only make out the faintest of trails here, if only because you
can proceed in no other direction.

A Strange Grove~
   The trees grow thick here and though there is no underbrush or grass, it is
sometimes hard to move. In the corner of your eye, shadows dart between trees.
Behind the fog, you can hear the cackle of wildlings and the chants of their
druid masters.

A Strange Grove~
   The fog gives way to a winding path through the grove. The canopy overhead
is deathly silent, but the fog all around you echoes with the barks and howls
and screeches of uncountable wild animals. You can see no eyes through the fog,
but you have the ever-present sense that they can see you.

A Strange Grove~
   You seem to be lost in the fog. It twists and tangles through the dense
trees, and you can't tell which way is forward or backward in the grove. The
leaves rustle in the canopy, but when you look up, all you see there is fog.

A Strange Grove~
   The trees grow too close together for you to do anything more than squeeze
through, and then you can't even do that. You try to move between the trees,
but the fog smothers you and you gasp for breath. You can only go back from
here, not forward.

A Strange Grove~
   The path twists and turns, sometimes barely visible in the undergrowth. The
fog keeps you from straying too far from the path, but you notice an odd burrow
beneath the roots of a great oak. The wildlings seem to be coming from the
trees, so perhaps the burrow will be safe.

A Strange Burrow~
   The entrance to the burrow looks as if it's barely large enough for a
person, but once you climb inside, you discover a tunnel large enough to march
a parade through. The walls of the tunnel are carved with long scratches, as if
this entire burrow were dug by wild beasts.

not grow here. There are no squirrels or rabbits. In the distance, you can hear

A Strange Grove~
   As you press through the fog, it suddenly turns to water! The entire grove
is flooded, with water as high up as the canopy. As you try to swim up for air,
roots grasp at your leg and drag you back down. Strangely, the roots don't seem
to stop you from walking along the forest floor.

   You move along the floor of the flooded grove, half-swimming and
half-walking, unable to swim to the surface to take a breath. The path is hard
to see now, but each time you deviate from it, a tree root rises from the
ground like a tentacle and pulls you back toward the path.

as if in tune with the primal movements of the plants around them. The fog in
the distance seems to glow redder and redder as you press deeper into the
Grove.

A Tree With a Staircase~
   As you plod through the trees, you barely notice your trail disappearing
behind you. But when you turn, it's completely gone, and you can't see the path
through the trees or the fog. As you wander, lost beyond hope, you come across
a peculiar tree with a wooden staircase wound around its trunk. Perhaps this
leads somewhere interesting?

   The staircase appears to be made from bent saplings and upturned roots. It
leads up into the canopy, but you can't see through the fog.

The Branches Above the Grove~
   The staircase brings you up to the lower canopy, where the branches are as
large around as a cow, easily strong enough to support your weight. The leaves
around you rustle constantly, and you're certain you are not alone, but you can
only trek forward from here. Or backward -- you're completely turned around.

The Branches Above the Grove~
   You balance carefully along the branch as far as you can go, but it ends
abruptly. There is only fog below you, and it's too hard to gauge the distance.
It seems you can only go backward afterall.

The Branches Above the Grove~
   The long, powerful branch brings you to a well-lit spot looking down on a
huge bonfire below. The forest canopy is thick here, and you have no trouble
balancing along the branch as you cling to smaller branches along the way. You
measure the distance to the ground with your eyes. It looks like you could get
down from here and investigate that bonfire.

A Strange Grove~
   Dozens of trees line the path here, their branches intertwined to make this
feel more like a corridor than a forest. The fog makes it difficult to see
behind you, but the path ahead is well-lit by a bonfire in the distance.

A Bonfire in the Grove~
   The grove grows more dangerous here, forming a thicket that seems to conceal
a hidden path. The glowing fog gives way to a smoky bonfire, piled high with
the bones of animals. That is, you hope those are animal bones. The ways of the
druids of the Grove are mysterious, and you can't tell if this bonfire is part
of a festival or instead if these are merely the remains of the last
adventurers who trespassed in the Grove of the Magiterranean.

A Hidden Thicket~
   The thicket opens into a small, hidden clearing in the trees. It looks like
you have stumbled upon a wildling nest. Bits of spiky black fur are stuck
against the brambles of plants in a location that was carefully selected to
keep interlopers out. It is unwise to stay long, as the wildlings who made the
nest are likely to return.
