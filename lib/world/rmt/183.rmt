A Collapsed Passageway~
   You enter a tight stone passageway, which looks like it collapsed long ago.
The walls were once carved with intricate writing, but are now too badly
damaged to make out any of it. The rubble is partially cleared, and may have
been knocked free by a recent earthquake.

A Sloping Passage~
   The passage slopes down beneath the rubble, deeper into the pyramid. As you
explore its depths, you come to what appears to be a solid wall, blocking
further passage.

wall symbols strange well-decorated~
   The wall is marked with strange symbols in an ancient language. It looks
like someone picked the correct symbol, because the wall has been pushed open.

A Hidden Burial Chamber~
   Despite the condition of the rest of the pyramid, this grand chamber is
well-preserved. The walls are covered in ancient symbols, each painted in gold.
The center of the room contains a glimmering sarcophagus on a dais. No light
from the outside reaches this chamber, but the lavish gold embellishments seem
to shine on their own.
