A Strange Grove~
   You have found yourself in a strange grove, at no point certain of which way
is in and which way is out of the forest. The trees are not dense, but their
thick canopy drowns out the sun, except for a few stray rays. A thick fog keeps
you from seeing more than fifty feet in any direction, and the call of animals
tells you that you are not alone.

A Strange Grove~
   The trees grow thick here and though there is no underbrush or grass, it is
sometimes hard to move. In the corner of your eye, shadows dart between trees.
Behind the fog, you can hear the cackle of wildlings and the chants of their
druid masters.

not grow here. There are no squirrels or rabbits. In the distance, you can hear

A Strange Grove~
   The trees begin to sway in the wind, with dead lower branches hitting you in
the face at every turn. The druids of the Grove seem unaffected, and they sway
as if in tune with the primal movements of the plants around them. The fog in
the distance seems to glow redder and redder as you press deeper into the
Grove.

A Bonfire in the Grove~
   The grove grows more dangerous here, forming a thicket that seems to conceal
a hidden path. The glowing fog gives way to a smoky bonfire, piled high with
the bones of animals. That is, you hope those are animal bones. The ways of the
druids of the Grove are mysterious, and you can't tell if this bonfire is part
of a festival or instead if these are merely the remains of the last
adventurers who trespassed in the Grove of the Magiterranean.

A Hidden Thicket~
   The thicket opens into a small, hidden clearing in the trees. It looks like
you have stumbled upon a wildling nest. Bits of spiky black fur a stuck against
the brambles of plants in a location that was carefully selected to keep
interlopers out. It is unwise to stay long, as the wildlings who made the nest
are likely to return.

The Dragon's Lair~
   You have stumbled into a dragon's lair! The mammoth cave has ended in a
truly gigantic chamber, and it seems a dragon has made its home in it. The back
of the cave is dominated by a huge nest, apparently made from whole trees. No
creature but a red dragon builds a nest so large. To the side, you can see
charred bits of armor, perhaps returned from the dragon's sensitive stomach.

tunnel is the sewers; the other appears to lead to a large chamber which,

   You have found what appears to be the basement of a building, although its
stairs are in shambles and the door is bolted shut. The walls are lit by
torches and a few storage crates are stacked in one corner. A bed of straw and
furs takes up most of the tiny space, and a small window near the ceiling vents
lets in fresh air that almost - almost - overtakes the smell of sewage.

The Second Floor~
   The long hallway is filled with stations where the Tower Skycleave's various
apprentices practice their experiments and conduct their research, hoping to
join the upper echelons of Skycleave's hierarchy. As if to inspire them, the
wall is lined with portraits of former masters of the tower.

The Base of the Staircase~
   The second floor, with its immaculate wooden floors, comes to a gradual end
here, as it curves up into a staircase and further up the tower. A long line of
the Tower Skycleave's former masters comes to an apparent end here at the
stairs, where its current leaders, Knezz, Barrosh, and Celiya occupy the final
three frames.

The Third Floor~
   The third floor rises from the end of the staircase with ceramic tile floors
and wooden walls paneled over the brick structure of the Tower Skycleave.
Though the curved hallway is long, you hardly feel tired. At times, the curve
is so subtle that it just seems like one endless, ascending hallway.

The Third Floor~
   This floor of the Tower Skycleave features the offices of the tower's
Residents - sorcerers who have earned their place in the upper echelon, but
who are still working to master the magical sciences. Most of the doors are
shut and locked, and perhaps mystically muffled.

The Third Floor~
   The tile floor is covered in a strange green spot, near a door marked
'Caution Otherworlders'. A sponge appears to be trying to scrub the stain free,
but it isn't having much luck. The sorcerer who enchanted it must be too busy
to pay attention.

The Third Floor~
   The long, curving third floor hallway takes on a strange odor here, perhaps
emanating from the door marked 'Lich Labs'. As you listen carefully, you manage
to make out a low wailing coming from behind the door.

The Base of the Staircase~
   The clean ceramic tile of the third floor rises here into a long, curving
staircase. There are windows here, unlike much of the hallway, and you suddenly
remember how high you've climbed up the long spiral of the Tower Skycleave.

The Top Floor~
   As the stairs of the Tower Skycleave's final staircase come to an end, you
find the floor's tiles change to a mosaic of soft, wooden shapes that form an
entrancing pattern. The windows next to the stairs show off the tower's immense
height, and you can see much of the countryside.

The Top Floor~
   This part of the Tower Skycleave's top floor belongs to the High Sorceress
Celiya, who oversees the tower's residency program. Her desk is made of sturdy
oak, and the walls are covered in locked glass cases displaying relics,
trophies, and books of all kinds.

The Top Floor~
   The office of High Sorcerer Barrosh is spartan, with a bare desk and
uncomfortable chair. The only book is on a pedestal, and is blank, perhaps a
work in progress. The floor has small piles of dust, perhaps the remnants of
former pieces of furniture, or Barrosh's most recent experiment.

The Top Floor~
   As you finally reach the end of the Tower Skycleave's immense spiral
hallway, you find yourself in the office of Grand High Sorcerer Knezz, the
tower's patron and leader. A plaque on the wall indicates he has been employee
of the year for nearly a century, meaning all those portraits of former masters
on the second floor must be ancient indeed. The office is lined in black
nocturnium, which seems to glow from some angles.

The Skycleave Cafe~
   The cafe is a rather more of a large, sunny nook off of the circular
hallway. The walls here have been papered over with pictures of birds and
flowers. There is a wooden bar with several strange machines that burble and
steam. A sign indicates that you can buy coffee or wine.

The Tower Skycleave Study Hall~
   The classroom is not large, and most of its floor space is devoted to small
wooden desks. The room is otherwise fairly stark except for a large blackboard.
Across the top of the board, chalkmarks spell out a strange, magical alphabet.

The Tower Skycleave Gift Shoppe~
   The gift shoppe is livelier than much of the rest of the Tower Skycleave,
perhaps in part due to tiny bubbles that float through the air, from nowhere in
particular. The brick walls are covered in shelves, each loaded with assorted
merchandise. A sign instructs you to type 'list' or 'buy'.

The Goblin Cages~
   This room is the first part of the Tower Skycleave that you've seen that is
in any way messy, and it's messy in a big way. The wall is lined with goblin
cages, most of which emit loud rattles and shrieks as their occupants voice
ceaseless opinions about their captivity.

The Goblin Cages~
   The cages extend all the way to the far wall. Some goblins are fortunate
enough to have their cage in front of a window, but most never see daylight. A
foul-smelling bin suggests not all of the goblin experiments go well, but you
can't bring yourself to lift the latch and open it.

The Pixy Races~
   The large windows bring in a cascade of sunlight, but they are covered with
a fine wire mesh which is clogged, in places, with a fine yellow dust. The
center of the chamber is a low table covered in a glass done with a tiny,
pixy-sized track inside. To the side of it is a coin slot, enchanted to handle
wagers and payouts.

A Resident's Lab~
   The lab is mostly empty, perhaps for the same reason that splinters of wood
and iron form debris piles against the walls. The room's sole defining feature
is a large platform with strong, enchanted chains attached to its floor.

The Lich Labs~
   For all its ominous name, this lab near the top of the Tower Skycleave is
fairly neat and orderly. But the lab is huge, and you can see its side rooms,
through arches on both sides, are not quite so clean. Crackling beams of light
cover the archways, but they only appear to stop the undead from passing, as
lab assistants have no trouble as they come and go.

The Experimentation Chamber~
   The Lich Labs must be a place of horror by night, because the walls of the
room are blocked by stacks of rotting caskets. It looks as if someone has been
digging up old graves, and they give off a powerful stench.

The Museum~
   This part of the Lich Labs is mostly shelves of strange objects, many of
them apparently very old. Some are under glass domes, and others locked in
cases, and some of those appear to be rattling and shaking. Some of the objects
hover above their shelves, as if possessed by some unearthly soul.

The Ground Floor~
   The Tower Skycleave is divided into four levels, each separated by a
staircase that spirals the inner column of the tower. The first floor caters
primarily to tourists. The second floor is where the apprentices conduct their
experiments. The third floor has more advanced research, while the top floor
holds the offices of the tower's masters.
