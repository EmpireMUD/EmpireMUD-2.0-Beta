An Unstable Portal~
   The torrentuous swirl of the portal's magical currents make it impossible to
see where you are, or where you're going! You can still hear the sorcerers back
in the tower, but you're not sure what lies beyond the portal.

Inside a Cupboard~
   You find yourself inside a large cupboard. A small mattress on the bottom
suggests someone has been living here, and the shelves are decorated with small
figurines and other items. The top of the cupboard is stepped, suggesting this
cupboard is underneath a staircase.

   Two shelves are hung along the edge of the cupboard, above the head of the
mattress. A set of small toy figurines is the only hint that this might be a
child's bedroom. Other items on the shelves include brushes, jars, and bags.
In fact, it looks like this poor child shares his bedroom with the household
storage. A blue plaque is mounted under the shelf.

The Temple Of Midgaard~
   You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing Gods, giants and peasants.
   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
To the west, you see the Reading Room.  The donation room is in a small
alcove to your east.

Cornfields of Popcorn~
   You find yourself standing in the middle of a cornfield that has gone
unharvested long past its prime. The brown stalks are twisted and bent by the
wind, and the ears of corn have dried out and burst in the sun, littering the
ground in a heavy snow of popped corn. In the distance you can faintly see a
manor house.

The Unstable~
   You are in a strange stable. The entire building twists and warps dizzyingly
from moment to moment. Bizarre beasts populate the stalls, and rather than
running straight along the bottom, the straw-covered floor twists around to the
ceiling like a corkscrew.

A Hobbit Hole~
   You find yourself in a tiny house, with a ceiling so low that you can barely
stand. The doors and archways are perfectly round, like nothing you've ever
seen before. The house is filled with knick knacks, tchotchkes, and kitsch of
all kinds. The smell of pipe smoke wafts in from the garden.

The Coat Closet~
The closet is a dark, cramped space.  It appears  to be very crowded in here;
 you keep bumping into what feels like coats,  boots, and other people
 (apparently sleeping).  One useful thing that you've  discovered in your
 bumbling about is a metal doorknob set at waist level into  what might be a
 door.  Next to it is a spring lever labeled 'QUIET!'.

A Long Row of Glass Shops (5th, Main)~
   You find yourself standing on a cement walkway next to a long row of strange
and extravagant shops. The front of each shop is made from a huge pane of glass
which must have cost a fortune, as each pane is crystal clear and free from
defects. The items in the shop window are like nothing you have ever seen, but
the bustling crowd of people seem eager to buy them. (Type 'list')
