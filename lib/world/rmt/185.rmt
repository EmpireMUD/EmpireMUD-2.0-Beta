An Overgrown Chamber~
   You have climbed down a large pile of rubble in one corner of this
collapsing chamber at the top of the temple. The embers of a recent campfire
smoulder in the centre of the chamber, lighting the room with a dim red glow.
The stone walls are almost completely hidden by layers upon layers of plants.

A Great Gate~
   You stand before a huge, thick stone gate, engraved with carvings of tribal
warriors dressed as eagles and jaguars. The gate is closed; you should look for
a way to open it. A newly made plaque nearby warns of the dangers within.

A Suspicious Gallery~
   Thick vines and dark shadows obscure the walls and floor of this wide
corridor. A faint breeze blowing through cracks in the uneven stone walls
rustles the leaves growing on the walls, producing an eerie hissing sound.

A Shadowy Chamber~
   Huge bas-relief carvings adorn the walls of this cavernous hall. No daylight
penetrates this deep into the temple. Instead, an eerie green light with no
apparent source fills the room, revealing a huge staircase leading deeper into
the temple.

carvings walls~
   The carvings covering the walls are mostly of snakes, people, and
snake-people. Whoever built this temple must have really liked snakes.

A Collapsing Staircase~
   As you descend the steps deeper into the temple, you come to a section where
the ceiling has completely caved in, blocking any further progress. However,
the falling rocks knocked a few stones loose from the floor. It looks like this
temple is built on top of something else. Vines snake down into the green-lit
depths below.

A Hidden Valley~
   You have climbed down the vines into a wide ravine, deep beneath the temple.
Leaves and vines line the curved stone walls. Several large shafts of light
shine through the high, uneven ceiling of leaves and stone. Nearby, at the base
of one such shaft of light, a grove of papaya trees is growing.

The Lower Gate~
   Following the ravine beneath the temple, you eventually come to an old stone
gate, like the one at the entrance of the temple, but much smaller. Vines have
forced it slightly open; you could squeeze through.

The Temple Depths~
   You have squeezed through the narrow crack and into the depths of the
temple. Nearby, you see the far side of the huge pile of rocks which blocks the
main entrance to this area. The eerie glow seems to have spread unobstructed by
the rocks, and fills this area as well.

The Ancient Treasury~
   You have reached the deepest part of the temple. Piles of silver and gold
coins are scattered around the edges of the room, and an elevated pedestal in
the centre of the room prominently displays the greatest treasure in the room.

An Intact Staircase~
   You step through the secret door and onto another staircase, the mirror of
the first, but untouched by the centuries. The carvings of snakes common
throughout the rest of the temple are replaced with a long series of carvings
depicting a man wearing a crown shaped like a sun.

An Ancient Throne Room~
   No vines grow on the vaulted walls of this ancient chamber. Sarcophagi
engraved with mystical symbols line the walls. A great stone throne stands
empty on the dais at the far end of the hall. A huge painting of the sun covers
the wall behind the throne, with a small archway in the middle.

   You step through the archway behind the throne and into a tall, octagonal
chamber, bare of decoration or ornaments. Above your head, a miniature sun of
emerald light swirls and crackles. An ornately carved stone sarcophagus lies
open in the center of the room.

A Pit of Snakes~
   You have fallen into a deep pit. The stone walls are built from large,
ill-fitted blocks and overgrown with vines. It should be easy to climb back up,
but you may have to deal with the source of the incessant hissing sounds
first...
