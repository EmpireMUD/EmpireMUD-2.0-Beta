A Precarious Ledge~
   You descend into the fissure, following a rock ledge along one wall. You are
immediately struck by the furnace-like heat rising from the magma below, and
your ears are constantly assaulted by a deafening roar. If you drop anything
here, it will probably be lost forever. Light shines from an opening in the
wall at the other end of the ledge.
   A stone plate lying nearby has words carved into it.

plate stone~
   The following words have been burned into the volcanic rock by some great,
concentrated heat: "Return the relics of the fiend to the earth and receive
their power for yourself."

fissure magma down~
   The almost unnatural heat radiating up from the magma at the bottom of the
fissure looks like it could destroy anything but magic itself.

The Fiend's Lair~
   You emerge on a narrow ledge in a large, domed cavern. Not far below is a
huge, boiling lake of magma. Ahead of you, a narrow rock bridge slopes downward
to a central pillar, barely elevated above the magma.

bridge rock narrow~
   The bridge is somewhat narrow but thick, formed from a black volcanic stone.
It will not collapse under the weight of a few adventures, and as long as
you're careful you should be able to stay on it.
