The Mouth of the Cave~
   A narrow path follows the sea water into the mouth of the cave, which is
much larger than it appeared from the outside. In fact, this seems like the
perfect place to hide a small ship. It looks like the cave goes much deeper,
if you are willing to explore it.

Beneath a Small Ship~
   As you wend deeper into the cave, you come upon a ship which, though small,
is blocking passage further into the cave. It looks as if it has run aground
here, as the water is too shallow to sail further.

   This little wooden sailing ship appears to have a nude goblin for its
figurehead, plated in what is almost certainly brass.

On the Deck of the Golden Goblin~
   The ship, though dirty, seems to be in good repair compared to most of the
goblin habitats you have witnessed. The masts are folded down, which is no
small feat of engineering for a goblin, because the cave ceiling here is low.
You have to hunch to avoid hitting your head.

The Mizzenmast of the Golden Goblin~
   The rear half of the ship is blocked by the mizzenmast, which has been
folded down to give enough clearance to enter this cave. From here, you can see
that the Golden Goblin is well and truly stuck in this cave. The goblins seemed
to be working on a way to remove it, but they have made no progress.

Floating Behind the Ship~
   You lose your grip on the Golden Goblin and fall into the water. It looks
shallow, but you can't seem to find sure footing. You could swim back to the
mouth of the cave from here, but as you start to move, the water begins to
ripple...

A Whirling Maelstrom~
   Water and air swirl around you as you are sucked deeper and deeper into an
underwater cavern. You struggle to catch your breath but cough up more salt and
water than air. For a moment, you struggle to hold onto the wall, but the
seaweed is slippery and you lose your grip.

An Underwater Cavern~
   You seem to have fallen through the maelstrom and into a pocket of air in an
otherwise fully-submerged cavern. The walls are thick with seaweed and odd
creatures, and the cavern smells of old fish. In the center, a small fire burns
to warm the air, and its smoke billows up into the water above.

Backtracking Toward the Start~
   You follow the disturbed sand in an attempt to retrace your path back to the
air bubble before your breath runs out. It looks like you found the right way
as you can hear the goblin sea witch chanting in the distance.

bubble, if you can hold your breath that long.

   The cavern opens up into a much larger chamber. Though the whole thing is
underwater, there still appears to be a pool in the center of the cavern. As
you enter, the walls tremble around you and bits of sand and debris fall from
the ceiling.
