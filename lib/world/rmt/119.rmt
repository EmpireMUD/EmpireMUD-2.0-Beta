The Central Chamber of Tower Skycleave~
   The vast central chamber of the Tower Skycleave stretches up above, where
you can see the second floor railing even from here. Directly above you, the
bottom of the ever-spiraling walkway forms a circular rim around the inside of
the chamber through which a magnificent nocturnium tree reaches down, bearing
the flickering flames that light the whole of the interior.

The Central Chamber of Tower Skycleave~
   Delicious smells seem to assault you from the archway to the east, where a
sign in the shape of an arrow guides you to the tower's cafe. A painting of the
tower hangs next to the archway. Even from here, the babble of the grand
fountain across from the cafe drowns out the bustle of the crowd. Above, the
great nocturnium chandelier stretches down through the center of the spiral
walkway, through which you can see across to the railing of the second floor.

   The portraits begin here with Grand High Sorcerer Abaris, founder of the
Tower Skycleave, dressed in sepia-tone robes and standing in front of a much
smaller version of the tower.
   Next is Flamella, Abaris's successor, dressed in a white gown and holding a
bloodstone staff, sitting in a quaint office. She's a frail old woman in the
portrait, though her hair is black-blue and pulled up into a frightening
beehive.
   The third portrait is of Gormon the Bowled, a portly old man with a frizzy
mane of salt-and-pepper hair and beard. The tower behind him is larger than
Abaris's version, made from cyclopean blocks, though it doesn't really resemble
the Skycleave of today. Gormon is dressed in a black robe and carries a small,
crooked wand rather than a staff.
   Grand High Sorcerer Fural, fourth master of Skycleave, is the final portrait
you can see without following the curve of the hallway. Fural is depicted as a
short, pale old woman with thick gray eyebrows. Her earlobes are stretched to
great size by discs made of iridescent abalone shell. She's wearing several
layers of deep purple robes and holding a wooden staff with a green gem.

gray-white and braided back. Her robes are deep purple and many-layered. Her
staff is rough wood with a green gem, perhaps jade, on the end. Below her
portrait, a plate is inscribed:

The Second Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The long, curving walkway circles the open central column of the tower, lit
by the upside-down tree chandelier that hangs down through the middle. A
flashing sign marks the archway to the east, which has glowing yellow dust
spots around it, marring the usually-spotless interior. The portraits of the
Tower Skycleave's former masters continue along the walls, alternating with
nocturnium light fixtures.

~
E

   The central chamber of the tower is an enormous cylinder with the ever-
spiraling walkway climbing its round ebony wall. A nocturnium chandelier in the
shape of a full-size, upside-down tree hangs down from the top of the tower
down to the first floor. There are no windows in the chamber, as it runs up the
tower's core. Doors off of the walkway lead to the tower's various rooms.

portraits paintings masters plates~
   The portraits of former masters of the Tower Skycleave continue around the
curve of the hallway, each one framed in ebony wood, with a nocturnium plate
underneath inscribed with the name in a uniform, elegant script.
   These portraits begin with Grand High Sorcerer Ulrica, a bony woman with
shimmering silver skin and white hair. Despite the hair, she looks rather young
and stands tall in her deep purple robes.
   The next portrait is of Spana, the tower's sixth master, a motherly woman
with dark brown hair worn in a single over-the-shoulder braid. Her gown is
dark purple with a sky-blue sash.
   Magnus the Small follows Spana. His epithet appears to be quite literal as
his portrait shows Magnus sitting on a paper weight on his desk, no larger than
a rat. Next to his portrait, Grand High Sorcerer Jabir appears in violet robes
standing before an early version of the tower.
   The portraits continue around the curving wall in both directions.
~
E
Ulrica~
   Grand High Sorcerer Ulrica is a tall, bony woman, though she looks rather
young even with stark white hair. In her portrait, her skin is shimmering
silver in a tone that's as hauntingly beautiful as it is unnatural. Like many
of the portraits, she wears dark purple robes. Beneath the portrait, an
inscribed plate reads:

Spana~
   Grand High Sorcerer Spana is a middle-aged woman with her thick, brown hair
braided over one shoulder. She has a warm smile and folded hands that give her
a motherly quality. She is depicted in a dark purple gown with a sky-blue sash
over one shoulder. Below the portrait, an inscribed plate reads:

Jabir~
   Grand High Sorcerer Jabir's painting shows him outside the tower -- or, at
least, an earlier version of it. The tower is shown made from stone blocks and
standing three stories tall, with large calamander double doors. Jabir himself
is a tall, thin man with a long brown beard. He wears a violet turban to match
his layered robes. Beneath his portrait, the nameplate reads:

Sorcerers Jadoo, Kemala, Bliant, and Rafaela.
~
E
Jadoo~
   Grand High Sorcerer Jadoo wears a violet angarkha, a type of short coat from
his homeland. His mustache and sideburns are dark brown with white accents, but
the lower part of his beard is stark white. Below his portrait, the nameplate
is inscribed:

   Grand High Sorcerer Kemala is a petite woman, painted perhaps at the age of
50, in a wrapped purple skirt and violet tunic with a sheer violet shawl. She
is depicted sitting, holding a nocturnium scepter with her hands folded in her
lap. Below her portrait, the nameplate reads:

Bliant~
   Grand High Sorcerer Bliant is shown in white robes, unlike the rest of the
old masters, who are mainly shown in purple or violet. Only the hem of her
outer robe is purple. She looks young for a master of the tower, with soft
features and bright red hair, which is wrapped in a white cloth. Below the
painting, the nameplate reads:

   Grand High Sorcerer Rafaela is a small, thin woman in a violet dress with
a sky-blue sash. The sleeveless dress shows off lean, muscled arms, both with
nocturnium cuffs below the shoulder. Rafaela's angular face bears a stern look
beneath her nest of black hair, which has a single purple streak in it. Below

The Goblin Cages Entry~
   This disaster area is probably the messiest room in all the tower. Large
cages line most of the walls, most of which look like they haven't been cleaned
in some time. One corner of the room has a small desk with a nocturnium lamp
sitting atop it. The floor is mostly clear, with a small platform with a ring
bolted to it in the middle.

reach of one of the cages; perhaps the cleaning staff no longer ventures in.

   Matching the room easily, this desk is a mess of papers, quills, and
different colored inkwells. A utilitarian lamp made of nocturnium has been
bolted securely to the desktop. Gouges mar the surfaces of the desk. Is that a
fingernail embedded in the side?

papers inkwells quills~
   As you try to make some sense of the chaos that is the desk you stumble
across a paper hidden under several others. It is stained and looks as though
it is an old memo. The ink is almost completely illegible and you can't
make out much. A second paper stuck to the back of this one with some gooey
substance keeps you from reading anything but:

       ... why the goblins keep trying to get in. Seems fruitless;
       they just end up in cages. Perhaps they've heard we have some
       old goblin knickknacks lying around? Still, seems foolish to
       risk it all for bits of jade. Have never known a goblin ...

The Goblin Cages~
   The long room would be large if not for all the cages, which go all the way
to the far wall. At full capactiy, this room could hold dozens of goblins,
though the sorcerers seem unconcerned that the conditions would be inhumane.
One or two cages are in front of windows, but most of the inhabitants don't get
a lot of light. The room's aroma is far from pleasant, but a truly disturbing
odor emanates from a large bin situated in the corner.

   This bin stands about four feet tall and is large enough around to fit a

could be squeezed into it. As you close in to get a good look at this bin, a
powerful stench overwhelms you. Before you are forced to back away, however,
you see that it seems to be of one piece with the wall behind it. There are
unusual scrapes along the floor next to it. Perhaps if you 'search' around, you
could find a way to move it.

The Pixy Races~
   A series of glass domes and tubes snake around the room as a track for the
sorcerers of Skycleave to race pixies. There is space to stand in the center
of the room, with a tall, swiveling chair for the race warden to observe. Large
windows, covered in a fine mesh, take up most of the east wall, allowing for an
excellent view and lots of light. A workbench is tucked off to one side, behind
the track.

   This workbench is lined with tiny crafting instruments. Various pixy sized
accessories line a board set along the back from small blunted dirks to vests.
Everything seems to be well organized; but of course, if something was missing,
it's not like you'd be able to find it.
~
E

   There are lots of pixies tending to their equipment between races, although
they stop to watch when other pixies are racing.
~
E
racetrack track~
   The racetrack circles around the room through four glass domes connected by
tubes. A fence, short relative to even the pixies, marks the path of the the
track. Portholes near the starting line allow entrants to attach their pixy
jars for the race.
   The exterior holds many tiny stalls where other pixies can be seen tending
to their wings and other gear. Each stall is set up with a window so the pixies
can watch their competition.
   The spectator area is inside the ring made by the domes and tubes. And in
the very center of the room, a tall chair gives the race warden a clear view of
the action.
   To check the status of the race, just type 'race'.
~
E
domes~
   The domes are crystal clear from the top and most of the sides, giving an
uninterrupted view of the entire track and the pixies racing around it. Four
domes make up the racetrack: a large dome with the start and finish lines, the
Forest Dome, the Lava Dome, and the Thunder Dome.

~
E
forestdome forest trees~
   The Forest Dome is dense with miniature trees, some of which are tall enough
that they protrude through holes in the glass dome and spread their canopies
above it. In this dome, pixies must expertly navigate the trees without
crashing. It is connected forward to the Lava Dome by a narrow tube and
backward to the starting line by a wider one.

~
E
lavadome lava~
   The glass of the Lava Dome glows neon-orange from the heat as actual lava
roils below. The air inside -- and, indeed, above -- the dome is wavy and
turbulent. Pixies must navigate the treacherous air and avoid burbling lava.
This dome connects forward to the Thunder Dome and backward to the Forest Dome
by narrow tubes.
   To check the status of the race, just type 'race'.
~
E
thunderdome thunder~
   You can see very little inside the Thunder Dome, whose only prominent
feature is a dark gray storm cloud. Pixies must navigate the zero-visibility
cloud while watching out for whatever hazards hide inside. They enter this dome
through a narrow tube from the Lava Dome but exit through a much wider one that
goes over the doorway.
   To check the status of the race, just type 'race'.
~
E
tubes~
   The racetrack's domes are connected by glass tubes, most so small the pixies
must cross them in single file, with no chance to pass. The wide tube between
the Thunder Dome and the finish line arches over the doorway. Aside from that
one, only the tube between the starting line and the Forest Dome is large
enough for pixies to try to overtake the lead.

The Apprentice Dormitories~
   The hall is narrow here as it runs through the apprentice quarters. A plain
yet sturdy door leads off to a bedroom, while the hallway itself curves around
the tower's central column. The walls are exposed stone blocks here, almost

The Second Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The second floor walkway, with its immaculate ebony wood floors, comes to a
gradual end as it subtly changes into stairs that continue to curve upward
along the wall of the massive chamber as they rise higher into the tower. The
long line of portraits depicting the former masters of the Tower Skycleave ends
just before the stairs with Grand High Sorcerer Knezz in the final frame.
Elegant nocturnium fixtures on the walls accompany the grand chandelier to
light the portraits and the walkway. Over the railing, you can see people
sitting around the fountain down below.

   The ebony walkway is wide enough for four people to walk abreast, with a
railing to ensure the fifth person doesn't fall. The floor is perfectly flat
where you're standing, but slopes downward toward the stairs to the first
floor. The tree-shaped chandelier hangs down the center of the tower.

~
E

   An incredible nocturnium tree hangs down from the very top of the tower,
reaching nearly to the fountain below with its spindly black branches. Each
branch bears a small oil lamp, lighting the entire central chamber like a

~
E
chamber central room~
   The central chamber of the tower is an enormous cylinder with the ever-
spiraling walkway climbing its round ebony wall. A nocturnium chandelier in the
shape of a full-size, upside-down tree hangs down from the top of the tower
down to the first floor. There are no windows in the chamber, as it runs up the
tower's core. Doors off of the walkway lead to the tower's various rooms.

   The ebony-framed portraits that line the long curve of the second floor
hallway end here with the current master, Knezz, his immediate predecessor,
Kofi, and the previous master, Wong.
~

Wong~
   Wong is a heavy man wrapped in violet and gray robes, with short-cropped
hair under a tall conical hat. He is shown next to the Tower Skycleave in its
current form, whereas the previous sorcrers in the hall are painted next to
older versions of the tower. Beneath his painting, the nameplate reads:
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 |       Grand High Sorcerer Wong       |
                 |    Great Builder, Passed Naturally   |

                 +--------------------------------------+
~
E
Kofi~
   Grand High Sorcerer Kofi is painted wearing a draping, violet and white
striped cloth over purple robes. On his head, he wears a small, round hat, also
in purple, stitched with gold and nocturnium. His skin is a deep, rich brown
color, with bright violet eyes and chiseled features. Below his portrait, the
nameplate reads:
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 |       Grand High Sorcerer Kofi       |

                 +--------------------------------------+
~
E
knezz~
   The portrait of Knezz is the last one in line at the base of the stairs. His
image shows him in his most familiar pose as he stands meditating outdoors in
his violet and gold robes. He looks younger in the portrait, which is painted
from a low angle so as to make him look almost like a giant next to the tower.
The expression on his face is serene and confident. The nameplate below his
portrait reads:
                 +-------------------------------------+
                 |      Grand High Sorcerer Knezz      |

A Small Bedroom~
   This private room is somewhat large, but with so much in it, it seems small.
A bed, chest, wardrobe, and desk take up the vast majority of floor space.
Personal effects are here and there, while papers lay scattered on the desk. A
landscape painting hangs on one wall and a smaller portrait sits on the desk.
Curtains are tied back to expose a vast window looking out over the land beyond

painting landscape~
   This landscape painting depicts a marshy scene. Bright green moss hangs from
drooping tree limbs and some of the trees tilt crazily. Dark, yet strangely
opalescent water dominates the ground with only a couple of small rises in it.
As you look closer you can spot eyes hiding in the shadows of the painting,
though you realize they are just part of the painting after a start. For such a
dreary scene the colors are vibrant and strangely beautiful.
~
E
desk papers~
   This mess might make sense to someone, maybe. Papers are scattered about in
no particular order, an inkwell has been toppled over and a small bit of ink
has stained the desk. It has all the markings of a genius mind, or possibly
just a messy resident too busy to clean their room. One paper catches the eye,
and as you take a quick look you read, 'The goblins break in so often, it
seems like they're looking for something in particular.' A small portrait sits
atop some of the clutter.
~
E
portrait~
   This portrait consists of a much younger Annaca and several people that

The artist has taken some liberties by adding a few flying pixies streaming out

A Large Bunkroom~
   For apprentice quarters this place isn't half bad. Bunk beds line the walls
with a wide walkway down the middle. A lamp fixture is hanging from the wall

   The entire south wall is painted with a large mural of Skycleave, standing
majestically over a frozen hillside. However, as you wade through the dense
collection of beds and desks and move toward the back of the room, the painting
seems to change. Now, instead of the tower, it depicts Grand High Sorcerer
Knezz bent over, holding a half-eaten fire melon, belching a cloud of smoke,
whilst farting a ball of fire in the other direction.

you can see a pair of floating staircases. One, at the bottom of the sloping
walkway, leads down to the second floor. The other, slightly above you, leads
up to the fourth.

   Unlike most of the third floor, there is no furniture just here. Perhaps the

E
chandelier tree upside-down inverted lamps~
   Most of the chamber is lit by a single enormous chandelier in the shape of
an inverted black tree that seems to grow down from the top of the tower. The
whole thing is sculpted from twisting, turning nocturnium wire, from trunk to
branch. And on uncountable thousands of its branches there are tiny oil lamps
that, all together, light every corner of the chamber.
~

   Most of the tower's accents, door handles, and even the chandelier are made
from matte black nocturnium metal. The door to the Lich Labs is also well-
reinforced by nocturnium bands.

The Third Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The long, curving ceramic tile walkway of the third floor transitions
smoothly into floating steps that ascend up to the top level. If not for the
calamander wood handrail, the steps would be difficult to climb as the tiles
seem to connect to nothing but the paneled wall. Between the steps, you have
a clear view of the second floor walkway and the first floor fountain far
below you.

   The staircases -- both here and across the central chamber at the other end
of the third floor -- have their steps attached only to the chamber's curving

The Eruditorium~
   This large chamber is mostly empty, save for a heavily-constructed platform
in the center of the marble floor. Thick, faintly glowing chains are bolted to
the surface of the platform. The paneled walls have dents and cracks along them
and some of the light fixtures are bent out of shape. What looks to be debris
from a workstation is piled up in a corner awaiting the cleaning service. You
can see some cabinets through a small archway on the south wall.

   The platform is part of the floor, but raised several inches above it.
Chains with massive bolts are attached to the outside of the platform. They
would probably secure most anything locked up with them as they glow a sickly
green color. As an extra precaution, a strange script has been written, carved,
embedded -- or maybe it's just there -- in many places of the platform. It
is difficult to get a true look at the script, but it too glows that same odd
green color.

   Whoever runs this lab really likes crystals. There are crystals on the work-

~
E
repository~
   Scaldorran's repository is an old stone oil lamp perched on a pedestal.
Parts of it are so worn as to give the impression that it has been around since
before brass lamps were first forged. Every inch of the lamp is cold to the
touch, yet water never forms on its sides. In the dark, it almost seems to
glow, but in bright sunlight it takes on a dark, sinister character.
   A lich is made of pure magic, of a sort that would quickly dissipate after
the death of a sorcerer. But when a sorcerer commands vast power and abundant
cleverness, it is possible to prepare a repository to anchor their magic to the
mortal plane after their body has rotted and their soul has moved on.

   The cold stone walls pour icy mist that pools on the floor. Work benches
along one wall are covered in odd tools and arcane implements. When you turn
back toward the door, you see broken caskets leaning against the wall beside
it. Locked chests under the work benches seem to rattle and shake on their own,
hidden from what little light spills from the lamp fixtures set high on the
wall. The chamber has one window, but it's boarded over. A stone table in the
center of the chamber has leather straps and no small number of stains.

   The back of the Lich Labs is more like a museum. Shelves, both free-standing
and hanging from the walls, are lined with artifacts of all kinds. Some are
under glass domes, others locked in cases; one is chained to a large metal post
which appears to be rattling and shaking. Some of the objects hover above their
shelves, as if possessed by some unearthly soul.

   Inside one dome is a large, square coin. It is standing on one corner and
slowly spinning. When it turns around a face can be seen. Amazingly, it gives
you a quick wink.
   Another dome has a scarab beetle that still appears to be alive. A third
dome looks empty, but it's held tightly shut by an iron strap. There's no

The Enchanting Labs~
   This room is dominated by a finely crafted circle embedded in the floor's
center. Light from the ornate nocturnium fixtures glints off of half-organized
piles of household items in the corners, stacked on tables, and generally
dispersed all over the lab. A portion of the east wall seems to waver like
the air over a fire, disturbing the visuals of a large painting of a bagel.

   There is a distinct border to this strange wall. It has a slight waver to it
which disturbs the pattern of light when you look at it just right. Centered in
the wavering area is an unusual painting.
~
E
painting bagel visuals~
You examine the painting on the wavering wall:
   The upper section of this painting is three people standing around a platter
made of a silvery metal. The first man looks like a disapproving old mentor.
The middle lady has a contemplative look on her face. The last man has a slight
smile as he examines the bagel sitting atop the platter. The one thing common
to all three people is the fact that it seems like they are all slightly
drooling. The bagel itself is sliced cleanly into an upper and lower half with
the upper half set askew to expose the fluffy inside. The top of the bagel is
sprinkled with seeds, flakes, and a fine greenish-white dust. Set beside it are
small tubs of various condiments. At the bottom, the nameplate says:

                  +---------------------------------+
                  |   'Behold, Everything Bagel!'   |

Embedded in the floor surrounding this circle is strange, hard-to-read script
that seems to undulate. Gold and silver diagrams connect to each other and to
some of the script making a confusing tableau.
~
E
corner household items piles~
   It looks as though someone, once upon a time, attempted to keep this pile of
toasters, brooms, mops, cups, pots, pans, and other various household items in
some sort of order. The efforts of that person have served well to create a
foundation for the other haphazardly stacked and thrown items in this corner of
the room. Occasionally the pile stirs faintly.

   While all the worktables look similar, they each seem to deal in a different
thing. Nothing on any of the worktables could ever make sense to anyone except
a magineer. The strange apparatus above each table is even more confusing.
Some have dangling tubes that seem to writhe leading to strangely designed
tools, each different and hard to look at. Disconcerting noises come from each
apparatus on the walls combining with voices and other sounds to make a
horrendous cacophony.

   Truly it resembles an enormous floating jellyfish, if jellyfish were made by
an eccentric wizard who never saw the sea. It is pointed on the bottom end
where all the tubes connect and dangle down. Through the transparent sides of
its body what look like a storm, flame, ball of mud, and a lightning bolt
circle around each other and occasionally collide. This must happen fairly
frequently, as nobody reacts to the *BOOM* that occurs.

   Many paintings in various sizes and shapes line the curving wall of the
grand chamber. The paintings are both colorful and not, some of them simple
black and white affairs and others popping with colors too bright and vivid to
bear. Many of them seem to celebrate the tower's occupants, past and present,
though you recognize very few people.
~
E
rugs~
   The many-hued violet rugs are plush and bordered with gold or silver. Some
of the rugs depict simple geometric designs in muted shades while others
display full scenes that play out across the plush fibers in great detail.
   One rug in particular depicts laborers laying the intricate wood floors that
surround you. Another shows an apprentice casting the patronus charm. A third
rug shows a phoenix that seems to grow, age, burn to ash, and repeat over and
over again.
   You peek underneath one of the rugs and notice there's a different scene
depicted on the back: it shows a swarm of goblins fleeing a burning cliffside.

The Upper Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The curving walkway continues around the grand chamber, passing by the door
to one of the high sorcerers' offices. This section is more austere than the
rest of the fourth floor, filled only with spindly tables covered in small
sculptures. Across the calamander railing, the trunk of the tower's enormous
chandelier grows downward, where it branches into a tree that glimmers with the
light of a thousand tiny oil lamps.

tables spindly~
   The tables have spindly legs that do not look substantial enough to hold up
their tops and the items on them. They are all made of dark and light striped
calamander wood, giving them a striking appearance, and carved with intricate
designs and patterns along the legs and sides. Each table is polished expertly
to show off the grains of the uniquely striped wood. Each table has a small
sculpture on it.
~
E
decorations sculptures devices orrery~
   The decorations on the tables are each different. Some of them look like
they have moving pieces. One is a jumble of complex components and crystals in
different shapes; another looks like a miniature orrery. Another table has a
pentagon-sided crystal obelisk that comes to a point that glows and shifts
between the colors of the rainbow in soft, muted shades, providing a small
amount of light.
~
E
flooring pattern entrancing~
   The floor is made of woods in various shades and intricately laid out of
differently shaped panels, with varying textures. The pattern it makes is
entrancing and alluring, trapping your attention for several moments as your
mind begins to wander and the pattern appears to move.

the rare metal. This price of this tower must have been astronomical.
~
E
railing handrail chandelier tree trunk~
   The striped handrail curves around the walkway that hugs the wall of the
grand chamber. Across the railing, the trunk of the grand chandelier twists
downward. Looking over the rail, you see that it branches out into an inverted
tree with countless tiny flames on its branches that light the floors below.
~
E
chamber column~
   The rotund chamber caps the massive central column of the Tower Skycleave as
the culmination of the ever-spiraling walkway. Here, near the top, only the
vaulted ceilings rise above you. This floor contains the offices and quarters
of the tower's high masters, and it is from here that they look down on the
apprentices below.
~
E
walkway curving spiraling ever-spiraling northwest nw southwest sw~
   The walkway is wider here than on the floors below and, as such, has chairs
and tables so that it can be used as a social space. The floor appears to rise
slowly toward the northwest and as it continues around the curve of the
chamber, the slope rises higher and higher until it ends at the Grand High
Sorcerer's office. To the southwest, it slopes downward toward the stairs. But
just here, where you're standing, the floor seems perfectly flat.

The Upper Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   Here, from the top of the ever-spiraling walkway, the Grand High Sorcerer
can look down over the entirety of the Tower Skycleave. A wide double-door in
the curved wall is flanked by four overstuffed chairs and a pair of golden
coffee tables, and the wall is hung with artifacts from across the globe. The
floor of the walkway is comprised of thousands of pieces of wood in all shades,
organized into shifting patterns of unlimited intricacy.
   Over the railing, the round opening in the center of the chamber is pierced
by the nocturnium sculpture that serves as the tower's grand chandelier, its
countless branches lighting the floors below. This floor is instead lit by
lanterns that hang on chains from the arching ebony beams of the high ceiling.

   A pair of golden coffee tables help to create a comfortable sitting area
outside the office door. Filigree work along the sides gives them an uncommon

~
E

   The door is made of heavy ebony wood and polished to a dull sheen. It is
decorated with engravings that are so delicate that at first glance it is
impossible to make them out in the wood. Every time you look at them, however,
they seem to be something different though the door seems to always look the
same from a glance or from a distance.

   On close inspection, the door is engraved with tiny scenes from Skycleave's
long and storied history.

   The nocturnium fixtures on this floor are accented with a tiny bit of gold
to make them stand out. They are delicate looking in their design and wholly
more intricate than anything seen in the rest of the Tower Skycleave.

   The painting shows a lion hanging by its claws from a treebranch, struggling
to find its footing. A panicked look from the lion tells you everything you

   This cozy apartment is full of plush, overstuffed furniture and fluffy

rainbow, though most of the room has a decidedly purple theme. A small hearth
provides a place to cook, although it looks as if it doesn't get much use.

   The walls and shelves are covered in things Barrosh has picked up on his
travels, and it seems he has traveled a lot. No single theme unites the items,
which include an assortment of masks, shoes and sandals, totems, and figurines.
On one shelf, there's a small skull with big, square eye sockets. On another,
a jade fox.
~
E

   The skull is on the small side, though it's not necessarily a child's. The
eye sockets are large and square, so it doesn't even seem to be human, although
it's quite similar.
~

   The little green fox is made from rough-worked jade. Its ears are perked up,
and it almost looks like it would be wagging it's tail.
~

   There are a dozen staves mounted on the walls, all different. Some are wood,
some are metal. Some have gems, others shells, still others have no decoration
at all. You try to touch one, but receive instead a small lightning bolt.
~

   Barrosh's certificates are too numerous to count. He appears to have
mastered dozens of schools of magic.

   The rug is woven from scraps of cloth and makes a sort of mosaic picture of
goblins around a monolith. The rug has a white background with deep purple
edges and accents. The goblins' clothes, too, are purple.
   You find some jade dust underneath the rug but there's not enough to bother
sweeping any of it up.

every shade of gray in between with some in muted shades of blue, red, brown,
yellow green and even purple sparsely spread out among them. Not a single stone
of the path is the same in the entire garden.
~

sculptures~
   Each sculpture is created from a different shade of stone. They are all
unique, however one in the shape of a rearing unicorn stands out among the rest
due to the clear crystal horn sticking out of its head. The rest are of various
people, abstract, or geometric in design.
~
E
topiary shrubs~
   Every topiary shrub and bush in the garden is formed into the shape of
animals and fantastical beasts of all kinds, from ones the size of a loaf of
bread to huge, towering ones that provide much shade. Every time you glance at
the shrubs they seem to be in a slightly different position than before and you
could almost swear that you can see them move if you watch, though they seem
rooted in place.
~

unicorn~
   This rearing unicorn sculpture is made of inky black stone that has been
polished to a high shine. It has a crystal clear horn that spirals several feet
from its forehead and catches and refracts the light into rainbows. It seems
as though the sculpture is watching you no matter which way you view it from.

   They are quite black, or gray, and they definitely aren't white. The marble

A Cozy Little House~
   Stray clothing, blankets, mats, and baskets have piled up in this little
square house. The white plastered walls are painted with stylized scenes of
people wading in the water and shucking clams, as well as household scenes.
   A steep, narrow stair leads up to the hole in the ceiling that serves as
both exit and smoke vent. Under the stairs is a small clay oven.

The Altar Below~
   The ladder descends into a small room half-filled by the base of the great
standing stone. The walls are smooth white plaster, but there is no floor, only
the bare rock of the cliffside. Here, you can see that the standing stone is
part of the cliff itself; you can see no seam.
   A simple basalt altar rests in front of the standing stone, covered in
hundreds of pearls in many colors, all unworked. The altar, like the walls, is
undecorated and austere. The ground in front of it is worn away from many years
of kneeling. Above the altar, a vertical tube protrudes through the ceiling.

into the altar, scattering them all over the top and onto the floor. They come

perfect spheres, but many are teardrop-shaped and some have unique, irregular
forms.

The Sepulcher of Orka~
   Beneath the public square you find an equally public tomb. The small, gray
bodies of deceased goblins in various states of decay lie on each and every
one of the dozens of slate shelves that line the smooth plaster walls of the
sepulcher. Light from the entrance glints off of small jade squares that have
been placed over their eyes.
   A curved staircase drops through the stone floor, leading down into a
chamber cut into the rock itself. No light or smoke comes from below, and you

A Dark Rock-Cut Chamber~
   The staircase curves down through a low, narrow passage, into a larger room.
You turn to get your bearings in the dark, waiting for eyes to adjust to what
little light bounces down from far above. As the room comes into view, you
quickly find yourself face to face with a skull, and instinctively take a step
back, bumping into a wall of bones that clatter as they settle.
   This is an ossuary, where the bones of the goblins are put to rest when no
flesh remains. It looks like they've all been disarticulated and sorted, with
shelves of skulls, piles of femurs, walls of ribs, and more. As your eyes
adjust further, you find that the chamber is larger than you realized. There
could be many dozens of generations down here.

The Eastern Rooftop Walkway~
   Atop the vast cluster of square houses stretches the rooftop walkway. Every
house is built wall-to-wall, forming a bustling plaza on top, with the roofs
connected by wooden ramps and ladders. Each roof has a small square opening
with a slanted cover, serving as both entrance and chimney.
   The city is built on a long, jutting cliff overlooking the vast ocean. To
the east, the city rises toward a towering monolith at the cliff's end. To the
west, it sprawls as far as you can see. Just west of here, the walkway is at
its narrowest, crossing a neck in the cliffside.

   The city covers nearly every inch of the top of the jutting cliffs. Dozens
or perhaps hundreds of houses are tightly clustered, each sharing walls with
its neighbors, making it impossible to assail the city without climbing on top.
The rooftops form a walkway as well as a public plaza that stretches over the
top of the entire city.
~
E

The Western Rooftop Walkway~
   Crossing the narrowest part of the city, which is now just a single house
wide as it crosses the neck of the cliffside, you are stopped from further
progress by damage to the rooftop. It looks as if part of the cliffside fell
into the sea below and took a house with it. The house that remains here has
lost part of its roof and there is no way to cross.

Wooden Steps Down the Cliffside~
   In a dizzying feat of bravery, you step onto the wooden beams that form the
stairway down the side of the cliffs. Each step is nothing more or less than a
flattened tree pegged into a mortise hole that has been carved in the cliff and
the gap between the steps is further than you'd like, giving you a clear view
of the rocky shore far below.
   The steps turn a blind corner around the jutting cliff. Below, they lead to
the great gate of the gobbrabakh. Above, they lead to the lowest houses, which
can barely be seen from down here, aside from the heavy logs that protrude from
the ends. Above the houses, you can see the top of the towering monolith that
watches over the city.

The Great Gate of Gobbrabakh of Orka~
   The long, treacherous wooden stairway reaches its end at an enormous gate
built mere feet from the end of a narrow ledge. The gate is solid wood, stark
white, and painted with hundreds of stylized faces that must represent goblins.
The frame around the gate is made partly from rock, which might once have
formed a full arch, and partly from enormous timbers. The whole thing stands
twenty feet tall and blocks any view of what lies beyond.
   Though you can't see the city from here, the tip of its towering monolith
still peeks out from beyond the cliffs above. Indeed, the gate is situated at
the very spot where the standing stone is no longer visible.

   Each of the faces is no larger than your thumbnail, but detailed and
differentiated by the exact shade of green, the shape of the ears and nose,

in outline.
   Hundreds of the tiny faces adorn the gate in several large clusters and many
scattered individuals or small groups. No names are visible to identify any
of the goblins.

The Stone Cauldrons~
   The air ripples and waves over three large cauldrons nestled in hot wood
fires on a sand-covered part of the rooftop walkway. Around them, dozens of
reed mats provide places to sit and eat. The cauldrons are on a high rooftop,
and every seat provides a spectacular view of the entire gobbrabakh, which
sprawls to the south and west. To the east, the horizon is dominated by the
towering standing stone.

A Great Standing Stone Overlooking the Sea~
   Here, at the east edge of the gobbrabakh, you find yourself staggered by the
immensity of the rough-cut stone that towers over you. It stands watch over the
city and the sea, visible at great distance from both. You can see far into the
distance in all directions, with the city covering the cliffs to the west, and
the sea that surrounds it.
   A well-worn ladder to the side of the stone descends down below. Next to it,
a small tube protrudes from the walkway. A wooden ramp to the south leads down
to the cliffside.

where fine arena sand covers a wide, shallow pit in the rocks. Houses flank the
arena on the north and west sides, providing lots of space for spectators.

ramp. Out below the cliffs, the turquoise sea stretches to the horizon.
