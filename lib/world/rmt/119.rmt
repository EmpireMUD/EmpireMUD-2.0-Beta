The Central Chamber of the Tower Skycleave~
   The vast central chamber of the Tower Skycleave stretches up above, where
you can see the second floor railing even from here. Directly above you, the
bottom of the ever-spiraling walkway forms a circular rim around the inside of
the chamber through which a magnificent nocturnium tree reaches down, bearing
the flickering flames that light the whole of the interior.

The Central Chamber of the Tower Skycleave~
   Delicious smells seem to assault you from the archway to the east, where a
sign in the shape of an arrow guides you to the tower's cafe. A painting of the
tower hangs next to the archway. Even from here, the babble of the grand
fountain across from the cafe drowns out the bustle of the crowd. Above, the
great nocturnium chandelier stretches down through the center of the spiral
walkway, through which you can see across to the railing of the second floor.

portraits paintings old masters~
   The portraits begin here with Grand High Sorcerer Abaris, founder of the
Tower Skycleave, dressed in sepia-tone robes and standing in front of a much
smaller version of the tower.
   Next is Flamella, Abaris's successor, dressed in a white gown and holding a
bloodstone staff, sitting in a quaint office. She's a frail old woman in the
portrait, though her hair is black-blue and pulled up into a frightening
beehive.
   The third portrait is of Gormon the Bowled, a portly old man with a frizzy
mane of salt-and-pepper hair and beard. The tower behind him is larger than
Abaris's version, made from cyclopean blocks, though it doesn't really resemble
the Skycleave of today. Gormon is dressed in a black robe and carries a small,
crooked wand rather than a staff.
   Grand High Sorcerer Fural, fourth master of Skycleave, is the final portrait
you can see without following the curve of the hallway. Fural is depicted as a
short, pale old woman with thick gray eyebrows. Her earlobes are stretched to
great size by discs made of iridescent abalone shell. She's wearing several
layers of deep purple robes and holding a wooden staff with a green gem.

   Gormon is a portly old man with frizzy, salt-and-pepper hair and beard. His

   Fural is a short woman with pale, almost gray skin. Her earlobes are
stretched to great size by discs made of iridescent abalone shell. Her hair is
gray-white and braided back. Her robes are deep purple and many-layered. Her
staff is rough wood with a green gem, perhaps jade, on the end. Below her
portrait, a plate is inscribed:

   The long, curving walkway circles the open central column of the tower, lit
by the upside-down tree chandelier that hangs down through the middle. A
flashing sign marks the archway to the east, which has glowing yellow dust
spots around it, marring the usually-spotless interior. The portraits of the
Tower Skycleave's former masters continue along the walls, alternating with
nocturnium light fixtures.

   The central chamber of the tower is an enormous cylinder with the ever-

portraits paintings masters~
   The portraits of former masters of the Tower Skycleave continue around the
curve of the hallway, each one framed in ebony wood, with a nocturnium plate
underneath inscribed with the name in a uniform, elegant script.
   These portraits begin with Grand High Sorcerer Ulrica, a bony woman with
shimmering silver skin and white hair. Despite the hair, she looks rather young
and stands tall in her deep purple robes.
   The next portrait is of Spana, the tower's sixth master, a motherly woman
with dark brown hair worn in a single over-the-shoulder braid. Her gown is
dark purple with a sky-blue sash.
   Magnus the Small follows Spana. His epithet appears to be quite literal as
his portrait shows Magnus sitting on a paper weight on his desk, no larger than
a rat. Next to his portrait, Grand High Sorcerer Jabir appears in violet robes
standing before an early version of the tower.
   The portraits continue around the curving wall in both directions.
~
E
Ulrica~
   Grand High Sorcerer Ulrica is a tall, bony woman, though she looks rather
young even with stark white hair. In her portrait, her skin is shimmering
silver in a tone that's as hauntingly beautiful as it is unnatural. Like many
of the portraits, she wears dark purple robes. Beneath the portrait, an
inscribed plate reads:

   Grand High Sorcerer Spana is a middle-aged woman with her thick, brown hair
braided over one shoulder. She has a warm smile and folded hands that give her
a motherly quality. She is depicted in a dark purple gown with a sky-blue sash
over one shoulder. Below the portrait, an inscribed plate reads:

   Grand High Sorcerer Jabir's painting shows him outside the tower -- or, at
least, an earlier version of it. The tower is shown made from stone blocks and
standing three stories tall, with large calamander double doors. Jabir himself
is a tall, thin man with a long brown beard. He wears a violet turban to match
his layered robes. Beneath his portrait, the nameplate reads:

Jadoo~
   Grand High Sorcerer Jadoo wears a violet angarkha, a type of short coat from
his homeland. His mustache and sideburns are dark brown with white accents, but
the lower part of his beard is stark white. Below his portrait, the nameplate
is inscribed:

old masters, who are mainly shown in purple or violet. Only the hem of her
outer robe is purple. She looks young for a master of the tower, with soft
features and bright red hair, which is wrapped in a white cloth. Below the
painting, the nameplate reads:

   This disaster area is probably the messiest room in all the tower. Large
cages line most of the walls, most of which look like they haven't been cleaned
in some time. One corner of the room has a small desk with a nocturnium lamp
sitting atop it. The floor is mostly clear, with a small platform with a ring
bolted to it in the middle.

   Matching the room easily, this desk is a mess of papers, quills, and
different colored inkwells. A utilitarian lamp made of nocturnium has been

   As you try to make some sense of the chaos that is the desk you stumble
across a paper hidden under several others. It is stained and looks as though
it is an old memo. The ink is almost completely illegible and you can't
make out much. A second paper stuck to the back of this one with some gooey
substance keeps you from reading anything but:

       ... why the goblins keep trying to get in. Seems fruitless;
       they just end up in cages. Perhaps they've heard we have some
       old goblin knickknacks lying around? Still, seems foolish to

The Goblin Cages~
   The long room would be large if not for all the cages, which go all the way
to the far wall. At full capacity, this room could hold dozens of goblins,
though the sorcerers seem unconcerned that the conditions would be inhumane.
One or two cages are in front of windows, but most of the inhabitants don't get
a lot of light. The room's aroma is far from pleasant, but a truly disturbing
odor emanates from a large bin situated in the corner.

   This bin stands about four feet tall and is large enough around to fit a

powerful stench overwhelms you. Before you are forced to back away, however,
you see that it seems to be of one piece with the wall behind it. There are

The Pixy Races~
   A series of glass domes and tubes snake around the room as a track for the
sorcerers of Skycleave to race pixies. There is space to stand in the center
of the room, with a tall, swiveling chair for the race warden to observe. Large
windows, covered in a fine mesh, take up most of the east wall, allowing for an
excellent view and lots of light. A workbench is tucked off to one side, behind
the track.

   There are lots of pixies tending to their equipment between races, although
they stop to watch when other pixies are racing.

   The racetrack circles around the room through four glass domes connected by
tubes. A fence, short relative to even the pixies, marks the path of the the
track. Portholes near the starting line allow entrants to attach their pixy
jars for the race.
   The exterior holds many tiny stalls where other pixies can be seen tending
to their wings and other gear. Each stall is set up with a window so the pixies
can watch their competition.
   The spectator area is inside the ring made by the domes and tubes. And in
the very center of the room, a tall chair gives the race warden a clear view of
the action.
   To check the status of the race, just type 'race'.

   The Forest Dome is dense with miniature trees, some of which are tall enough
that they protrude through holes in the glass dome and spread their canopies
above it. In this dome, pixies must expertly navigate the trees without
crashing. It is connected forward to the Lava Dome by a narrow tube and
backward to the starting line by a wider one.

lavadome lava~
   The glass of the Lava Dome glows neon-orange from the heat as actual lava
roils below. The air inside -- and, indeed, above -- the dome is wavy and
turbulent. Pixies must navigate the treacherous air and avoid burbling lava.
This dome connects forward to the Thunder Dome and backward to the Forest Dome
by narrow tubes.
   To check the status of the race, just type 'race'.
~
E
thunderdome thunder~
   You can see very little inside the Thunder Dome, whose only prominent
feature is a dark gray storm cloud. Pixies must navigate the zero-visibility
cloud while watching out for whatever hazards hide inside. They enter this dome
through a narrow tube from the Lava Dome but exit through a much wider one that
goes over the doorway.
   To check the status of the race, just type 'race'.
~
E
tubes~
   The racetrack's domes are connected by glass tubes, most so small the pixies
must cross them in single file, with no chance to pass. The wide tube between
the Thunder Dome and the finish line arches over the doorway. Aside from that
one, only the tube between the starting line and the Forest Dome is large
enough for pixies to try to overtake the lead.

   This open lounge houses several couches, chairs, and tables. Being the
common area for the students of Skycleave, apprentices come and go as they
please. Stray teacups, books, and various minor magical items are spread around
the room. The polished mahogany walls, upon which hang a large collection of
portraits, reflect the soft glow of the lamps.

The Second Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The second floor walkway, with its immaculate ebony wood floors, comes to a
gradual end as it subtly changes into stairs that continue to curve upward
along the wall of the massive chamber as they rise higher into the tower. The
long line of portraits depicting the former masters of the Tower Skycleave ends
just before the stairs with the current Grand High Sorcerer in the final frame.
Elegant nocturnium fixtures on the walls accompany the grand chandelier to
light the portraits and the walkway. Over the railing, you can see people
sitting around the fountain down below.

   The ebony walkway is wide enough for four people to walk abreast, with a
railing to ensure the fifth person doesn't fall. The floor is perfectly flat
where you're standing, but slopes downward toward the stairs to the first
floor. The tree-shaped chandelier hangs down the center of the tower.

~
E

   An incredible nocturnium tree hangs down from the very top of the tower,
reaching nearly to the fountain below with its spindly black branches. Each
branch bears a small oil lamp, lighting the entire central chamber like a
thousand twinkling stars.
~
E
chamber central room~
   The central chamber of the tower is an enormous cylinder with the ever-
spiraling walkway climbing its round ebony wall. A nocturnium chandelier in the
shape of a full-size, upside-down tree hangs down from the top of the tower
down to the first floor. There are no windows in the chamber, as it runs up the
tower's core. Doors off of the walkway lead to the tower's various rooms.

   The ebony-framed portraits that line the long curve of the second floor
hallway end here with the current master, Knezz, his immediate predecessor,
Kofi, and the previous master, Wong.
~
E
Wong~
   Wong is a heavy man wrapped in violet and gray robes, with short-cropped
hair under a tall conical hat. He is shown next to the Tower Skycleave in its
current form, whereas the previous sorcrers in the hall are painted next to
older versions of the tower. Beneath his painting, the nameplate reads:
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 |       Grand High Sorcerer Wong       |

~
E
Kofi~
   Grand High Sorcerer Kofi is painted wearing a draping, violet and white
striped cloth over purple robes. On his head, he wears a small, round hat, also
in purple, stitched with gold and nocturnium. His skin is a deep, rich brown
color, with bright violet eyes and chiseled features. Below his portrait, the
nameplate reads:
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 |       Grand High Sorcerer Kofi       |

~
E
knezz current sorcerer grand final~
   The portrait of Knezz is the last one in line at the base of the stairs. His
image shows him in his most familiar pose as he stands meditating outdoors in
his violet and gold robes. He looks younger in the portrait, which is painted
from a low angle so as to make him look almost like a giant next to the tower.
The expression on his face is serene and confident. The nameplate below his
portrait reads:
                 +-------------------------------------+
                 |      Grand High Sorcerer Knezz      |

   This private room is somewhat large, but with so much in it, it seems small.
A bed, chest, wardrobe, and desk take up the vast majority of floor space.

E
painting landscape~
   This landscape painting depicts a marshy scene. Bright green moss hangs from
drooping tree limbs and some of the trees tilt crazily. Dark, yet strangely
opalescent water dominates the ground with only a couple of small rises in it.
As you look closer you can spot eyes hiding in the shadows of the painting,
though you realize they are just part of the painting after a start. For such a
dreary scene the colors are vibrant and strangely beautiful.
~
E
desk papers~
   This mess might make sense to someone, maybe. Papers are scattered about in
no particular order, an inkwell has been toppled over and a small bit of ink
has stained the desk. It has all the markings of a genius mind, or possibly
just a messy resident too busy to clean their room. One paper catches the eye,
and as you take a quick look you read, 'The goblins break in so often, it
seems like they're looking for something in particular.' A small portrait sits
atop some of the clutter.
~
E
portrait~
   This portrait consists of a much younger Annaca and several people that
resemble her. The entire group is standing outside of the tower's entrance.
The artist has taken some liberties by adding a few flying pixies streaming out

   For apprentice quarters this place isn't half bad. Bunk beds line the walls

   The entire south wall is painted with a large mural of Skycleave, standing
majestically over a frozen hillside. However, as you wade through the dense
collection of beds and desks and move toward the back of the room, the painting
seems to change. Now, instead of the tower, it depicts Grand High Sorcerer
Knezz bent over, holding a half-eaten fire melon, belching a cloud of smoke,
whilst farting a ball of fire in the other direction. A pair of pixies are
depicted flying around the tower.

   Chairs and tables along the length of the third floor make the walkway as

The Third Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The immaculately clean walkway is interrupted by a strange smell that seems
to emanate from one of the doors here, marked by an ichor-green sign. It seems
to be the only door that's not locked shut in this part of the tower and it
sounds like someone is inside; the rest are magically muffled.

   Green flames dance on the nocturnium light fixtures that flank the door to
the Lich Labs. The little flames seem to form different shapes as they move.
They are darker near the base, brighter at the tips, and cast the area just in
front of the door in an eerie light.
~
E
door north~
   This door stands apart from the others in this section of hallway. It is
much wider and set into an arched frame with thick bands of nocturnium across
the heavy, dark wood. There is a suspiciously strange smell coming from around
the door but it is impossible to place what the smell could be exactly.

   Across the central chamber, through the branches of the grand chandelier,

The Third Floor Walkway of the Tower Skycleave~
   The long, curving ceramic tile walkway of the third floor transitions
smoothly into floating steps that ascend up to the top level. If not for the
calamander wood handrail, the steps would be difficult to climb as the tiles
seem to connect to nothing but the paneled wall. Between the steps, you have
a clear view of the second floor walkway and the first floor fountain far

embedded -- or maybe it's just there -- in many places of the platform. It

repository~
   Scaldorran's repository is an old stone oil lamp perched on a pedestal.
Parts of it are so worn as to give the impression that it has been around since
before brass lamps were first forged. Every inch of the lamp is cold to the
touch, yet water never forms on its sides. In the dark, it almost seems to
glow, but in bright sunlight it takes on a dark, sinister character.
   A lich is made of pure magic, of a sort that would quickly dissipate after
the death of a sorcerer. But when a sorcerer commands vast power and abundant
cleverness, it is possible to prepare a repository to anchor their magic to the
mortal plane after their body has rotted and their soul has moved on.

along one wall are covered in odd tools and arcane implements. When you turn
back toward the door, you see broken caskets leaning against the wall beside
it. Locked chests under the work benches seem to rattle and shake on their own,
hidden from what little light spills from the lamp fixtures set high on the

You examine the painting on the wavering wall:
   The upper section of this painting is three people standing around a platter
made of a silvery metal. The first man looks like a disapproving old mentor.
The middle lady has a contemplative look on her face. The last man has a slight
smile as he examines the bagel sitting atop the platter. The one thing common
to all three people is the fact that it seems like they are all slightly
drooling. The bagel itself is sliced cleanly into an upper and lower half with
the upper half set askew to expose the fluffy inside. The top of the bagel is
sprinkled with seeds, flakes, and a fine greenish-white dust. Set beside it are
small tubs of various condiments. At the bottom, the nameplate says:

   It looks as though someone, once upon a time, attempted to keep this pile of
toasters, brooms, mops, cups, pots, pans, and other various household items in
some sort of order. The efforts of that person have served well to create a
foundation for the other haphazardly stacked and thrown items in this corner of

there is little room to walk between worktables, shelves, and prototypes of all

   Many paintings in various sizes and shapes line the curving wall of the

black and white affairs and others popping with colors too bright and vivid to
bear. Many of them seem to celebrate the tower's occupants, past and present,
though you recognize very few people.

   The many-hued violet rugs are plush and bordered with gold or silver. Some
of the rugs depict simple geometric designs in muted shades while others
display full scenes that play out across the plush fibers in great detail.
   One rug in particular depicts laborers laying the intricate wood floors that
surround you. Another shows an apprentice casting the patronus charm. A third
rug shows a phoenix that seems to grow, age, burn to ash, and repeat over and
over again.
   You peek underneath one of the rugs and notice there's a different scene
depicted on the back: it shows a swarm of goblins fleeing a burning cliffside.

the curved wall is flanked by four overstuffed chairs and a pair of golden
coffee tables, and the wall is hung with artifacts from across the globe. The
floor of the walkway is comprised of thousands of pieces of wood in all shades,
organized into shifting patterns of unlimited intricacy.
   Over the railing, the round opening in the center of the chamber is pierced
by the nocturnium sculpture that serves as the tower's grand chandelier, its
countless branches lighting the floors below. This floor is instead lit by
lanterns that hang on chains from the arching ebony beams of the high ceiling.

On one shelf, there's a small skull with big, square eye sockets. On another,

The Top of the Tower~
   The roof of the Tower Skycleave is a huge garden with paths of large stone
slabs, sculptures, topiary shrubs, and many flower and herb beds. A waist-high

whole countryside. Dark marble benches and leafy shade trees provide ample
space for reflection.

   The paths are made of light and dark stone, each stone has been carved with
figures, shapes and symbols. The stones vary in shade from black to white and
every shade of gray in between with some in muted shades of blue, red, brown,
yellow green and even purple sparsely spread out among them. Not a single stone
of the path is the same in the entire garden.
~
E
sculptures~
   Each sculpture is created from a different shade of stone. They are all
unique, however one in the shape of a rearing unicorn stands out among the rest
due to the clear crystal horn sticking out of its head. The rest are of various
people, abstract, or geometric in design.
~
E
topiary shrubs~
   Every topiary shrub and bush in the garden is formed into the shape of
animals and fantastical beasts of all kinds, from ones the size of a loaf of
bread to huge, towering ones that provide much shade. Every time you glance at
the shrubs they seem to be in a slightly different position than before and you
could almost swear that you can see them move if you watch, though they seem
rooted in place.

   This rearing unicorn sculpture is made of inky black stone that has been

   The white plaster walls are richly painted with vignettes of domestic life
in this cozy little house. There are reed mats on the floor as well as on the
two low platforms that serve as beds. Small doorways in one wall appear to lead
to tiny store rooms.
   The only exit is a sloped ladder up to a square hole in the south side of

standing stone. The walls are smooth white plaster, but there is no floor, only
the bare rock of the cliffside. Here, you can see that the standing stone is

   A simple basalt altar rests in front of the standing stone, covered in
hundreds of pearls in many colors, all unworked. The altar, like the walls, is

   The staircase curves down through a low, narrow passage, into a larger room.
You turn to get your bearings in the dark, waiting for eyes to adjust to what
little light bounces down from far above. As the room comes into view, you
quickly find yourself face to face with a skull, and instinctively take a step
back, bumping into a wall of bones that clatter as they settle.
   This is an ossuary, where the bones of the goblins are put to rest when no
flesh remains. It looks like they've all been disarticulated and sorted, with
shelves of skulls, piles of femurs, walls of ribs, and more. As your eyes

The Central Plaza of the Eastern Rooftop Walkway~
   The towering spire of the gobbrabakh's monolith rises over the eastern
rooftops as the only thing tall enough to see in any direction. These rooftops
come to a low spot here, where several of the houses form a large plaza atop
their roofs, beneath dozens of other houses from which hundreds of onlookers
can view public events.

   The salty scent of the sea gives way here to the fragrant aroma of seafood,
as someone is surely boiling clams nearby. The walkway, formed by the conjoined
rooftops of many small homes, ends to the north, where the aroma originates.
In the east, the towering monolith rises from the edge of the city.
   Below you, down one of the many square openings in the rooftops, you can see
a messy little house, though it's difficult to stand near the entrance for long
because it also serves as the home's chimney. A wooden ladder descends through
the smoke.

a wooden stairway down the cliff. Most of the view of the city is obscured by
the closest houses, joined by ramps to this one. To the northeast, the great
standing stone towers over the houses, visible from every rooftop.
   The houses leading down to the stairway bear the same square openings with
slanted covers that can be seen across the city, situated on the south side of
each roof, opening to the east. Beyond the stairs, to the south and east, you

house is built wall-to-wall, forming a bustling plaza on top, with the roofs
connected by wooden ramps and ladders. Each roof has a small square opening
with a slanted cover, serving as both entrance and chimney.
   The city is built on a long, jutting cliff overlooking the vast ocean. To
the east, the city rises toward a towering monolith at the cliff's end. To the
west, it sprawls as far as you can see. Just west of here, the walkway is at
its narrowest, crossing a neck in the cliffside.

flattened tree pegged into a mortise hole that has been carved in the cliff and
the gap between the steps is further than you'd like, giving you a clear view
of the rocky shore far below.
   The steps turn a blind corner around the jutting cliff. Below, they lead to
the great gate of the gobbrabakh. Above, they lead to the lowest houses, which

built mere feet from the end of a narrow ledge. The gate is solid wood, stark
white, and painted with hundreds of stylized faces that must represent goblins.
The frame around the gate is made partly from rock, which might once have
formed a full arch, and partly from enormous timbers. The whole thing stands
twenty feet tall and blocks any view of what lies beyond.

openings slanted covers entrances chimneys~
   Every rooftop has a small, square hole in its south side, covered by a
slanted roof to keep water out. These holes are the only entrance to the homes,
and also vent smoke from the ovens. Some have ladders protruding from them.

cluster houses homes city sprawl gobbrabakh west rooftops roofs walkway~
   The city covers nearly every inch of the top of the jutting cliffs. Dozens
or perhaps hundreds of houses are tightly clustered, each sharing walls with
its neighbors, making it impossible to assail the city without climbing on top.
The rooftops form a walkway as well as a public plaza that stretches over the
top of the entire city.

Ramps connect spots where pairs of houses are at slightly different levels.

On the Cliffside~
   The rooftop walkway ends with a wooden ramp down onto the cliffside itself,
where fine arena sand covers a wide, shallow pit in the rocks. Houses flank the
arena on the north and west sides, providing lots of space for spectators.
   The city's towering standing stone is almost directly overhead, up the north
ramp. Out below the cliffs, the turquoise sea stretches to the horizon.

nearly every inch of them. Here, the arena is one of the only places where bare

An Endless River~
   You're standing knee-deep in a muddy river, distracted for a moment by light
glinting off the rippling surface. The soothing babble of the river and the
crackle of the campfire drown out every fret and fetter; you have all the time
in the world to fish. This is the sort of dream you never want to wake up from.

   You made this small campfire halfway between the river and the forest so
you'd have a place to cook up whatever you manage to catch in the river.

through your body and touches every part of you. For the first time in a long
time, you feel at peace.
