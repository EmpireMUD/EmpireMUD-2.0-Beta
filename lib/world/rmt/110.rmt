Inside the Gigantic Nest~
   You climb into the nest, aided by the roots of the massive trees that make
up the nest's walls. Whatever creature builds such a nest must be enormous, and
ferociously strong. It might be best not to anger it.

   The walls of the nest are made from whole trees, some with leaves still
attached. The tree roots make it easy to climb down from the nest.
