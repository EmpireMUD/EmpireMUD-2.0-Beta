Halloween of the Dead~
   Hey all you crazy ghosts and goblins, it's time for another Halloween! From
October 1 to November 2, you'll find pieces of candy when you kill mobs
anywhere in the world. Each type of candy starts a daily quest that will earn
you points toward this event. There's a fixed number of points available, so be
sure to grab them all each day!
~
   That's all for this Halloween, ghosts and ghouls, but don't worry: the
winter holiday is just around the corner. And you'll definitely see the
headless centaur again next year.
