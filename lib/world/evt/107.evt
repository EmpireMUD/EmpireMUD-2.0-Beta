Winter Wonderland~
   The holiday season is upon us and there are presents for everybody! From
December 1 to January 6, look for the Winter Wonderland adventure on your
'nearby' command. Visit every day for presents from Father Christmas, and fight
off the grinchy demon before he ruins the holidays for everyone.
There's a lot to do:
- Get 10 different gifts from Father Christmas, one per day.
- Stockings have 8 minipets to collect, or other prizes.
- Defeat the grinchy demon to earn some Christmas spirit.
- Make your empire festive!
- The upgrade glitter reward lets you improve the sweater, the gift sack, and
  the red hat.
- Complete 5 daily quests each day to earn event points and stockings. Dailies
  change each day and may come from:
  - Inside the Winter Wonderland adventure.
  - The Guild of Adventurers.
  - Any wandering vampire.
  - Boys and girls around your towns (during the day).
  - Your stable, Christmas tree, snowman, and sleigh.

   Alas, the winter holidays are over for another year. You have finally driven
off the grinchy demon and you can lean back, count your gifts, and spend some
well-deserved time with friends and family. And don't worry, Father Christmas
will be back again next year!
