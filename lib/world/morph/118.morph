   This oversized teapot is pearly white with a purple base and curved purple
lid. The teapot's spout forms the enormous nose of the face on the side of the
teapot which, to your surprise, can talk!

   The otherworlder hunches low as it runs, occasionally hitting its head. It's
a lot taller than a human, with dappled periwinkle skin. It wears some kind of
scale armor that appears as thin as a sheet, allowing it to move effortlessly
with its four curved, boneless arms and legs. It narrows all four of its black
eyes to vertical slits as it considers its chances of escape in each direction.

   The periwinkle blue otherworlder has long spikes protruding from its back
and from its upper pair of arms. The lower pair, thankfully, is smooth. It's
rather large, struggling at times to move without getting stuck. Its thin scale
armor appears undamaged by the spikes. It turns furiously as it considers the
best way to escape the tower.

   The enormous, perwinkle blue otherworlder scarcely fits as it struggles to
find a way out of the tower. It has grown considerably since it was released,
and stretches its paper-thin scale armor almost to the limit. The otherworlder
has two legs and four arms, though at times it seems to prefer to run on all
sixes. Its head is covered in small, narrow black eyes that dart in different
directions as it considers its escape.

   The reddish-brown warthog seems befuddled. It looks at you, looks around,
looks down at its hooves, then back to you again. It's a long creature with the
look of a demonic pig, with vicious tusks coming out both sides of its long
snout and lean, mean little legs. At least, they'd be mean if it knew what to
do with them. As it is, the poor warthog is just standing there looking dumb.

this one is just spinning in place.
