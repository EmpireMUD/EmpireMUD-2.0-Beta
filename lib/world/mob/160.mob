   The translucent flesh of this goblin is stretched over a skeleton with
little to no musculature or fat protection. A black cloud of magic seems to
drift up from him, and glints of silver shine out as he spins a skull in his
hand.

   A monster made up of a mixture of bones looms over you with it's arms
outstretched. The head is clearly from some large beast, perhaps a rhino,
perhaps a small dragon, or one of any number of other such creatures. And the
rest of the body is well proportioned to said skull.

   This clearly female goblin skeleton stands dressed in an astrakhan cloak and
little else. Under the folds there's a skeleton frame, dressed in a variety of
plant matter. With vines taking the place of her circulatory system, almost
unnoticeable fruits growing in where her organs belong, and different types of
moss replacing skin and hair.
