   This towering, red-skinned demon has goat-like horns wreathed in flames atop
its snarling visage. Its bare, muscular arms, thick as tree-trunks, strain
against the dark iron shackles binding its wrists to the rock behind it.

   Greater phoenixes such as this one are drawn to the sides of those who fight
evil. They have the power to return from their ashes if slain.

   This obsidian-skinned demonic steed has a mane and tail of flames, and
hooves of molten iron that leave smoking craters in their wake! Someone has
fashioned metal barding armor for it, and the hellcharger's own heat causes the
armor to emit a dull red glow.
