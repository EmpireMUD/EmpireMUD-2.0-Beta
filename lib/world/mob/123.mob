   This tremendous brown creature is undoubtedly a dragon, but its scales are
covered with fur from snout to tail. If it can fly, you don't see where the
wings would be. Its eyes, huge yellow orbs with thin black slits for pupils,
watch you as you watch them. Its ears follow you as you move, and it seems
hungry.
To fight it, type: difficulty <Hard | Group | Boss>

   Though it's on the small side for a dragon, this vicious fluffy creature is
easily large enough to carry you on its back. When it lands, its thick fur and
large limbs hide the giant leathery flap that allows it to fly in the air. But
whether it's on the ground or in the sky, it's still a formidable dragon.

   This adorable creature, called Dracofelis by the erudite sorcerers who study
it, is a fur dragon. It has the wide jaws and cunning mind of a dragon, but
it's not much larger than a house cat and it could easily be mistaken for one.

   The drake is like a small dragon. Perhaps not as smart as a true dragon, it
is nevertheless formidable in combat and voracious after each victory. It seems
loyal to its mage -- a rare characteristic in dragons.
