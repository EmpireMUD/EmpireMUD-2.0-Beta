   This tremendous brown creature is undoubtedly a dragon, but its scales are
covered with fur from snout to tail. If it can fly, you don't see where the
wings would be. Its eyes, huge yellow orbs with thin black slits for pupils,
watch you as you watch them. Its ears follow you as you move, and it seems
hungry.
To fight it, type: difficulty <Hard | Group | Boss>

   Though it's on the small side for a dragon, this vicious fluffy creature is
easily large enough to carry you on its back. When it lands, its thick fur and
large limbs hide the giant leathery flap that allows it to fly in the air. But
whether it's on the ground or in the sky, it's still a formidable dragon.

   This adorable creature, called Dracofelis by the erudite sorcerers who study
it, is a fur dragon. It has the wide jaws and cunning mind of a dragon, but
it's not much larger than a house cat and it could easily be mistaken for one.

   The drake is like a small dragon. Perhaps not as smart as a true dragon, it
is nevertheless formidable in combat and voracious after each victory. It seems
loyal to its mage -- a rare characteristic in dragons.

   The serragon is so big it could be mistaken for a mountain of ice! Its long,
slender, limbless body twists and coils around the area, making it difficult to
escape. Each time you turn around, you're facing another of its coils.
   The serrated scales down the creature's snake-like body leave long grooves
in the ice as the serragon moves. Underneath, the scales look furry, with icy
tufts visible whenever the creature turns. Cold vapor oozes from the creature's
pores, freezing the ground on contact. You turn and find yourself face-to-face
with the serragon's massive head, like a frilled snake with the maw of a lion,
with rows of swordlike teeth that seem to go all the way down its throat.
   The serragon clacks its gaping jaw at you as you try to back away. It's seen
you now, and there's nowhere to run!

   Though it's larger than a horse, the hatchling is miniscule in comparison to
the full-grown serragon that left the long grooves in the frost. The palm-sized
scales that run the length of the hatchling's body are serrated on the edges,
though they lay flatter than the scales on the adults. Around the margins of
each scale, beneath a delicate layer of cold vapor, you can see feathery
hoarfrost that barely protrudes.
   When the hatchling sees you, it starts clacking its toothy jaws and,
ominously, you hear more clacking in the distance in response.
