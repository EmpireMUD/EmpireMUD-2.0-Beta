   The mummified husk of this ancient ruler offers little clue to his
appearance in life. His jewelled golden raiment, however, attests to the great
wealth he must once have possessed, and the emerald flames burning in his empty
eyesockets hints at his great magical strength.

   This serpent lord has the lower body of a giant serpent, melding into the
upper body of a four-armed human woman. All four of her arms grip exotic,
curved swords in the stance of a trained warrior. She stands head-and-shoulders
above even the tallest human, and her forked tongue flicks out to taste the air
as she examines you...

   This elephant-sized serpent has massive feathered wings with beautiful,
many-colored plumage that shines softly in the dim light of the hidden valley.
It floats effortlessly in the air in complete defiance of its massive weight,
and a gentle breeze swirls in a circle around it, lightly ruffling its colorful
feathers.
