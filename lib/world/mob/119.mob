   The spirit fades in and out as moves around the room, visible against the
black walls but nearly transparent when it passes in front of a light fixture.
The spirit has no distinct form; you can barely be sure it was once human.
Violet and gold streamers trail behind it as it moves, leaving a faint sparkle
in the air behind it.
   As you watch the spirit, it seems to take an interest in you, too. It makes
its way to you, moving its head as if it's studying you. You step backwards and
bump into the buffet as the spirit reaches out toward you. A soul-chilling wave
passes through you, from your head to your neck, down your spine, filling you
so completely that even your shadow seems to shiver.

   Dylane the Younger was sent, at great expense, to Skycleave by his father,

spent a great sum of money and no small amount of influence to ensure his son

   Weyonomon is -- or rather, was -- a promising young apprentice. He still
wears the white robes he earned here, which hang in stark contrast to his
golden brown skin. His eyes are the hollow, smoky-black depressions of the
unliving, but his face bears a soft, friendly smile. He stands in front of one
of the artifacts, channeling ghastly energy from it.

D
   It stands in the center of the room, sometimes so still that it looks like a
sculpture. It looks like it's made of living nocturnium ore, still in its raw
form with chunks of black rock sticking out. In form, it resembles a hunched
person, though it has six arms and indistinct legs. The lowest pair of arms are
thick and rocky, almost resembling muscles, while the upper four arms are
slender and formed from long, twisting cables of wrought nocturnium.
   If the sculpture-creature was made to resemble a man or woman, you're not
sure which. Its face bears a mouth but no eyes, nose, or ears, though it has
been sculpted to have a thick brow ridge above where the eyes would be, and the
brow is very expressive when it speaks.
   Goef the Oreonic can 'attune' skystones for you.

   The wooden cabinet is mahogany, stained with a slight violet tinge, with
three sliding drawers that clatter open and shut as it hops along. Though it
has no arms, it seems capable of just enough magic to clean up the files that
have been strewn about.
   Ametnik was young when he came to Skycleave to study as an apprentice,
though he showed promise from a young age. But he was quicker to learn spells
than perform them, and in the end, he was a disappointment to them.

M
7
say The majestic Tower Skycleave has existed in many forms for hundreds of years, but this one is by far the greatest.~
M
7
say It was Grand High Sorcerer Rafaela's vision to build it from stones of power. She searched the ends of the earth to find enough of them...~

   The swab is little more than a poplar handle and a dense mop of white yarn,
though it has been animated to swoop around, persistently trying to clean any
floor or ground beneath it. Miraculously, it never seems to get dirty. The
headband around the yarn is checkered violet and white, with a tiny tower
stitched in.
   Skycleave's claw game fell into disuse for many years as its original
creator lost interest after his death and none of the other teachers were ever
clever enough to repair it.

   The wand has freed itself of its master and now makes its own decisions,
floating free of any master. Still, it seems to have found someone it likes to
follow, and it does so loyally. The wand is made from a thin hazel branch. The
handle is intricately carved with many tiny keys, each slightly different,
while the business end of the wand is uncarved and unfinished.
   Since the early days, wise men and women have known of the power that grows
in wood as it taps mana hidden deep beneath the world. A living tree is a
conduit for natural magic; a cut tree, properly prepared, can do the same for
the more civilized uses of mana.

   The doorstop is wedge-shaped and looks to be cast iron, though it's old and
unpolished such that rust grows on it like fur. It seems to be scampering
around on its own, stopping occasionally to investigate a crumb.
   It is seen as a rare privilege to spend a lifetime studying at Skycleave.
Annelise Larsen mastered the Deleon Enchantment and, for her genius, spent
another two.

   You have managed to find a shadow that doesn't belong. It's small, it's
rather dark, and you can't get an idea of its shape because it seems to change
as it turns.
   As you're looking at the shadow, it seems to shrink -- at least, at first.
But it seems to grow curious as it realizes you aren't a threat, and it
stretches a cautious tendril toward you, before yanking it back and shrinking
down again.

   At first glance it looks to be a fairly ordinary traveling cloak. But they
don't usually float in midair, so a better assessment would be to say this is
an extraordinary and well-traveled cloak. It seems to follow along close behind
you.
   Clingy cloaks were originally envisioned as a rescue tool for villagers lost
in the wilds. The cloaks are flung from the top of Skycleave, whereupon they
seek out any uncloaked person and wrap them tightly. Unfortunately, they
turned out to be unsafe for children.

   The footstool is a plus little square with deep purple fabric and mahogany
legs. The corners are set with little tassles that wave as it hops around like
a dog. This could be the perfect pet.
   Though the Tower Skycleave has acquired a reputation for frightening magical
experiments, and deservedly so, it's very unlikely that the footstool's
resemblance to a dog comes from it actually being a transmogrified dog. They
rarely transform animals.

   It's hard to take your eyes off of the odd creature; it is both hideous and
beautiful at the same time. It is large enough to be a small dog, with the
strange articulated legs and bulbous eyes of an insect. Its six legs sprawl
widely to the sides, supporting its weight close to the ground.
   But the most curious part of the bug is that it's made entirely of water.
You can watch the ground wave and ripple through the bug's carapace and when
you get too close, it shakes a wing and splashes you with water.

   The tiny, green-skinned creature is trapped in an equally tiny cage, all
except its feet, which stick down from the forward-tilting cage to let the
poor thing walk on its own. It sings as it plods along, though it never seems
to finish a song.
   The goblin's knees have wooden pins through them and articulate like a
hinge. On closer inspection, this goblin is a puppet!
   For many years, a constant and endless supply of goblins have arrived on
Skycleave's doorstep, its windowsills, and occasionally its sewer drains.
The sorcerers have theorized that goblins are drawn to the tower's magic and
have happily repurposed the little invaders.

   Skycleave's magichanical tinkerers first created these fans during a
devastating summer heatwave. But when summer ended, a particularly punny
sorcerer upgraded the fans to dispense more than just cool air.

   The verdant little guy seems happy -- even mirthful -- as he walks around in
circles. He seems small for a goblin, though, and when you kneel down to get
a look at him, you find he's made of wood, with articulated joints and lovely
little violet tunic with matching pants. The detail work is quite fine: the
puppet has lifelike green eyes and even has a piece of shell jewelry in its
nose. But just as you start to wonder how lifelike it really is, it bumps into
you. Twice.
   Goblins have lived on the fringes of human society since time immemorial,
often finding themselves in conflict over scraps and waste.
