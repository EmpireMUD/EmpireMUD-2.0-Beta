   Though Annaca's face is strained and contorted as she struggles to hold the
mana shield, it bears few lines or creases of its own. Annaca is young,
especially by Skycleave's standards. Her golden brown hair is pulled into a
line of buns down the back of her head and what stray strands aren't tied back
hang loose and wild. She wears a loose set of layered robes in midnight blue,
making it impossible to see what she might have stashed underneath.

   Venjer is a small woman, though she stands tall and proud, light on her feet
and ready to face whatever comes at her. She's as green as any goblin you've
seen, even in the stange light of the maze, with a little button nose and wide,
black eyes. Her brown hair is cut short in the front, barely grazing her brow,
but hangs long in the back, where it covers short collar of her armor.
   Though she's known as the Fox, her fur armor appears to be beaver and skunk,
with the stripes of the skunk fur dyed bright orange. The armor is tailored
exactly to her lithe frame and she moves effortlessly in it as she searches the
maze with her gnarled old wooden staff.

   Ravinder looks positively exhausted. His apprentice robes are dirty from
moving supplies and one of his hands is bandaged from the palm to the iron
bracelet on his wrist. His hair is still wrapped in a violet dastar, a type of
turban, above a bruise on his forehead. He has piled a blanket on top of
himself haphazardly, such that it's only covering part of his robed body,
though he doesn't seem to be trying to sleep.

wool toga with a violet stripe running the length of the cloth. His lightly
bronzed complexion, aquiline nose, choice of clothing, and short imperial hair

sort of person, though it looks like they have several extra arms.
   As you watch the shimmer move, you realize it's not as small as you thought
it was -- it was just further away. Whoever you're seeing, they're actually
a lot bigger than you are. They're moving around the first floor but they seem
oblivious to what's going on around them; they don't even seem to notice you

   There's no way to tell which of the many worlds this creature might have
come from. The only thing you're sure about is that it doesn't want to be here.

   Kara Virduke is nearly seven feet tall, such that she must stoop to work in
some parts of the lab, but when she stands up straight, you feel quite small.
Her broad, strong shoulders could swing a greatsword, but all she holds is a
thin, gnarled calamander staff. Her flame-orange hair rolls off her head,
cascading over the shoulders of her silver-accented red gown like a wild
waterfall at sunset.

down, revealing cropped soot-black hair and pale skin. His inky black cloak
is too dark and too loose for you to make out any part of his body or see what

   When you enter the room, you do not initially notice Trixton Vye. It's not
until he picks up a disembodied arm that he comes into focus. He holds up the
fleshy, half-rotted arm and whistles, and what flesh remains on the bones turns
to ash and blows toward Vye himself, apparently absorbed as it touches the skin
of his face and neck.
   Trixton Vye is decrepit, hunched like an old man, with thin white hair and
yellow teeth. He dresses as a noble in silk and fur and finery, but he has the
visage of a ghoul. His milky eyes turn ice blue only while he absorbs the
corpse-flesh; the rest of the time, you're not sure he can even see you.

   The shade, once merely a projection of the powerful enchantress Mezvienne,
has become the shadow of its former self as it absorbs the full power of the
Tower Skycleave. At the heart of the shadow, the gnarled wand of the late
Grand High Sorcerer Knezz glows an inky purple.
   The formless shadow expands, sending smoky tentacles into every relic and
artifact in the room. Tentacles stretch out the window, through cracks in the
walls, and between the marble tiles of the floor. Tentacles poke and prod at
you, trying to find a way to drain your power as well. Worse, it seems to be
working.

   Mezvienne the Enchantress floats limp and bloody in the time stream, her
back split open when the great lion emerged. Skithe Ler-Wyn, the Lion of Time,
is ethereal and enormous, like a great spirit, with glimmering fur; her mouth
alone is large enough to swallow you whole. She looms over you, both part of
the vortex and separate from it, watching you with deep, piercing eyes.
   You can type 'skip' to shorten Skithe Ler-Wyn's cutscene.

   Though the drape of his face shows that days have come and gone since he
last slept, Moneryl looks fairly young, with none of the hard creases or
speckled blemishes of age. His silk robe bears the inky blue of night, though
instead of stars, it is dotted with bits of dust and the dried crumbs of many
meals. Moneryl's triangular silver cape, however, is as stiff and perfect as
everyone else's.

eyebrows give the slightest quiver.
   The armor Nayyul wears is made of wooden plates studded with knobs of bright
red and violet glimstone. In shadow, they seem to emit a faint glow. The armor
is tied together through holes in the wood with brown silk ribbons. On his
back, Nayyul wears a stiff, silvery cape in the shape of a peaked triangle.

underneath which he's wearing a white floor-length silk cassock. Behind him,
his stiff triangular cape sticks out backwards to follow his crooked posture.

he plods up and down the glimmering staircase.

forward, his gauntleted hand clasped tightly around the shaft of his pike. His
glistering green armor appears to be cut from a singularly large gemstone. It
is as intricately carved as the palace around you, and inlaid with smaller red
and blue gems. On his back, he bears a stiff, triangular cape in silver and

   Lotte is rather short, though she wears stark white hair in a tall beehive
style that rather resembles a mushroom, especially as her unusually high,
arched eyebrows grow into the elaborate hairdo like stems. Her reddish-brown
silk suit is less embellished than the others you've seen in the city, and
perhaps made in a different style. However, she wears the same triangular cape
in silver and yellow that can be seen on the back of everyone here.
   Lotte touches everything as she walks -- the stone staircase, the walls of
the buildings, and every carving or sculpture she passes. She shows a keen,
almost childlike interest in every facet of the city.

bright sun. Iridescent bangles on her wrists and ankles barely jingle and the
triangular cape on her back, adorned with patterns of silver and yellow, stays
perfectly still as she moves with the elegance of a trained dancer. She gives
you a crooked smile as you pass her.

   Though she is blessed with the delicate features of a young maiden, Queen
Vehl nevertheless sits rigidly upright with the somber demeanor of a monarch.
Whenever you manage to catch her eyes glancing down at you, a coy, crooked
smile crosses her face, if only for a moment.
   The Queen wears an iridescent suit made from shimmering silk that seems to
be every color at once. Behind her, silver and yellow wings affixed to the
throne make her look almost divine.
   You forget, for a moment, as you stare at her violet eyes, that Queen Vehl
isn't even really here. All that sits on the throne is this ethereal image of
her -- an illusion, crafted by magic, perhaps to let her guide her people from
somewhere else.

   The giant Iskip is truly huge -- you'd scarcely reach his ankles if he were
standing on level ground with you. As it is, he's knee-deep in the water,
you're standing on an enormous stump, and you come up to his waist.
   Iskip is clad in a gold and violet robe that floats on the water around his
knees. The robe is so large you can see the individual strands of criss-crossed
linen. The double stitching at the edges looks to be gold and nocturnium
filament, but it's so large that it must have taken every mine on two
continents just to make the threads.
   Iskip's long brown beard and hair keep you from getting a good look at his
face, especially from your tiny vantage point. He wears nocturnium beads in
his beard with gold writing on them, but you can't read it from here either.
His shadow on the water is eerily red and you watch as it moves on its own. But
like the giant himself, the shadow is far too large for you to see the whole
thing from here.
