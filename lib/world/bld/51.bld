   You are standing inside a small hut. The walls and ceiling are constructed
from branches of various sizes and are held together loosely by many smaller
branches. The hut itself looks as though it could be dismantled with a
moment's notice and moved to another location. It also doesn't seem to offer
much protection against the elements.

   You are huddled inside a cozy log cabin. It is made of large, stripped
trees from the forest and seems much stronger than the smaller huts found
elsewhere. The cabin is also more permanent than the huts, it can't be taken

   You are standing inside a small, cozy house. The walls are made of wood
and the ceiling offers superb protection from the rain. It's also warmer in

bathe~
D
   Steamy air fills your lungs as you approach the baths. A pair of large
pools consume much of the floor space, and fires burn at their sides to heat
the water. This is a place of cleanliness, so attendants regularly add fresh
water to the bathing pools.

   From the outside, the tower looked huge. But now that you're inside, the
first words that come to mind are musty and cramped. Every inch of wall is
lined with oak bookshelves, packed full with tomes. Shining baubles, glittering
gems, and worn pestles cover the stone tables that sit around the room. A tall,
winding staircase leads to the top of the tower, although you can't tell what
is supporting the stairs.

   You are standing beneath a great portcullis. This is the entrance to a
magnificent stone structure the likes of which are unrivalled anywhere. The
construction is superb, possibly the best you've seen yet. The building is
very imposing, and yet somehow welcoming -- that is unless you don't belong.

   These are the military barracks, where soldiers are housed and trained. The
sleeping quarters are lined with cots and hammocks, and the scent of roasted
meat wafts from the kitchen at all hours. So long as the troops are well-fed
and well-trained, there is little need for the empire to fear.

   The mint's tall granite walls dwarf its machinery, which stamps out coin

guarded as it is well-staffed, to ensure none of the king's treasure goes
missing. The mills are quite worn, but they still churn out coins by the pound.
