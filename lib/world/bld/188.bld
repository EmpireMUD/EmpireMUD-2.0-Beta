   You find yourself in a parlor covered in cobwebs, though the velvet
furniture looks well-groomed. The hardwood floors are well worn in clear paths
across the room. The air is a little too cold, and as you watch your breath
condense, you think you catch the reflection of someone moving out of the
corner of your eye.

   The candles in the chandelier are mere wax drippings, serving as little more
than a place to attach a cobweb in this aged and unused great room. Though the
ceilings are high, dust in the air catches every stray beam of light and you
can rarely see more than a few feet in front of your face. When you hold
perfectly still, you can feel the floorboards twitch and tremble beneath you.
But perhaps it's just the old house settling.

   The ceiling is low and you must duck to avoid the beams that hold up the
great room above, and duck further still to avoid the spiders who stalk the
many webs that cover those beams. But the spiders above you are of little
concern compared to the earthen floor beneath you. The ground is lumped in the
shape of graves, too numerous to count. The light flickers for a moment, and
you swear you hear a groan from below.

tomb~

   This grand mausoleum looks as if it has been carved from a single mountain
of marble, from floor to pillar to ceiling. Even your heartbeat echoes through
the polished halls as no sound goes unheard in the realm of the dead. Crypts
line both sides of the mausoleum, so well-maintained that not even a speck of
dust is visible on their gleaming lids.

   The staircase descends into an ossuary filled with the bones of the dead. 
One wall is lined with skulls, another with ribcages. The domed ceiling is made
from interlocked femurs, and looking up at it is enough to send a chill down
your spine. There's a hidden door under the stairs.

   The attic's low, sloping ceilings force you to stoop. It's musty, but nicely
appointed with velvet curtains and antique furniture. A small, dusty window
lets you look out over the surroundings, but only if you get close enough to
see through the haze.

   The center of the mansion is devoted to a grand staircase wide enough to
march a full legion. At the top and bottom it links to smaller staircases
leading to the attic and the basement.

   The east wing of the mansion is a rather impressive library, filled to the
ceiling with books. However, each time you pick up a book, you find it written
in a different language that you cannot read. The shelves are covered in an
inch of dust, but each time you blow the dust away, it settles back onto the
same spot.

   The west wing of the mansion is devoted to the gallery, filled with
paintings, busts, and statues of long-dead residents. Opposite these works of
art, the windows have been permanently covered with velvet drapes so that no
sunlight enters the candle-lit room.

   This cobwebbed parlour might be called the stretching room because it's a
place to stretch, put your feet up on a footstool, and chat about the ghastly
state of the kingdom. Or perhaps it's because of the walls, which seem to
stretch upward forever toward a ceiling that seems ever more distant. A coat
rack stands near the door.

   The vertically-striped wallpaper only makes the ceiling look that much
