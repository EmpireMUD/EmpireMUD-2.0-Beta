   As you step into the grand ballroom, you almost lose your footing. The floor
is made of perfectly smooth ice, polished until it looks like a silver mirror.
The high ceilings are decorated with fairly lights and a moon roof cascades
light across the floor. Any groove or pit in the icy floor instantly heals
itself, so this room also doubles as a skating rink.

   The hall is grand in every sense, from its cathedral ceilings with hoarfrost
accents, to the walkway wide enough to drive three carriages abreast. The
icicles hanging from the ceiling chime as an icy wind blows through them,
though it's warm enough down here that you're barely shivering.

   The cavernous throne room looks as if it was carved from pure ice. The
ceiling is bordered in long, sharp icicles, and the walls are highlighted by
hoarfrost. The throne itself sits on a raised staircase of ice, overlooking
nobles and commoners alike.

   This long gallery looks as if it's carved from pure ice, with every window,
arch and accent highlighted in snowy frost. Ice sculptures line the inside
wall, opposite the grand windows.

   This incredible ice palace rises from the ground like a glacier, with
dagger-like icicle parapets and jagged, frozen stones to make climbing the
walls impossible. Steam rolls off the frozen blocks, but they never thaw. The
magic that holds this palace together must be powerful indeed.
