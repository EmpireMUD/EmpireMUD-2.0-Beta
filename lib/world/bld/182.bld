   The great room of the guildhall is spacious, but it has been filled with
chairs and desks, for its far-flung members to use when they're passing through
the city. The mahogany walls are windowless, but light is provided by glowing
chandeliers. For so much clutter, the guildhall is surprisingly well-kept.

   Rising from the dark mahogany guildhall, this brick tower gives you an
unobstructed view of the city. Tables are strewn with strange trinkets and
unusual potions, along with handwritten notes and scribbled drawings.

   The stairs descend into the basement, built on a strong foundation of stone
and supported by huge wooden pillars. The entire basement is filled with
bookshelves, packed with copies of the guild's arcane knowledge.

   Tucked behind the great room, this office is rather small. But unlike the
rest of the guildhall, it is free of clutter. Only a desk and two chairs fill
the room, and all decoration is restricted to the walls.

   This vault is not very large, and this guildhall's charter is still fairly
new, but the shelves are already lined with fascinating and exotic items. A
small safe is tucked in the corner, and securely locked.

   This rustic home has been built on a small platform, strapped to the back of
a young atlasian tortoise. The house is modest in size, but devoid of windows
as it requires solid walls to survive the heavy footfalls of the tortoise. A
cozy chair is bolted to the floor next to the hearth.

   Though more of an alcove off of the main house than a full room in its own
right, this bedroom is comfortably padded and cozy enough to sleep in. Springs
beneath the feather bed reduce the atlasian tortoise's heavy plodding to a
calming sway.
