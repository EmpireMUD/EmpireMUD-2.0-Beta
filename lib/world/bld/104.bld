   You've come across a small hamlet, ablaze and beset by the undead. Most of
the citizens have fled, but it looks as if the city needs help. With no army to
come to its rescue, the hamlet's only hope is you!

   The tent, though magnificent as a feat of goblin engineering, appears to be
made from hundreds of loosely stitched rat skins, and it smells no better than
it looks. The tent poles are decorated with the spoils of war including skulls,
hides, and badly damaged armor. A roaring fire burns in the center of the tent.

   It looks like the goblins have been feeding pigeons to hawks, and using the
hawks as letter carriers!

   This laboratory is little more than a rat-skin tent with a hearth, a fire,
and some racks for lab supplies. The whole thing has the familiar stench of
goblin engineering. The lab seems more portable than most alchemy facilities,
but only marginally.

   This is a rough dolmen -- a rock tomb used by goblins. Huge stone blocks
have been used to make a burial chamber, which is then covered in dirt. Only
weeds and rubble cover the surface.
