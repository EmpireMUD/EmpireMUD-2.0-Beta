   Upon entering the cabin of this ship, it clearly isn't intended for comfort.
A pair of nets act as beds, two small cupboards hold personal affects, and a
single central strip of floor acts as walkway.

   This is a well-constructed guard tower, anchored by long hydra bones. It is
tall, allowing it to see over most buildings and structures. The tower shoots
at any unescorted trespassers it sees. The tower is made from bone, so it is
not well protected against invasion. Hopefully, it will be enough defense. The
tower may be upgraded by typing upgrade here.
