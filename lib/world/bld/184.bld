   Climbing inside the short silver chariot, you find its plush seats to be
among the most comfortable you have ever sat upon. The rest of the interior is
rather small, and every part of it is covered in strange wires and glowing
script. The windows are made from fine glass, in panes so large they must have
cost a fortune. As you sit in silence, you realize the chariot is making a low
growl, though it is pulled by no animal. Truly you have never seen anything
like this before.

   The strange, glowing text appears to be numbers, although you cannot discern
their significance.

   Stepping inside the strange blue box, you find it is much, much bigger on
the inside. In fact, you step out for a moment and then step inside again to be
sure you weren't dreaming. The copper walls have an almost organic shape to
them, and the ceiling is supported by almost tree-like tendrils of cool cyan.
At the center of the room is some sort of console, though you aren't sure what
it does.

console center The console is round, and covered with switches and levers. It attaches to the ceiling via a tall tube, which pulses rhythmically.~
