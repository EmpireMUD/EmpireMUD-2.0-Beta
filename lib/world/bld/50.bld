   You are inside a tent made of animal hides. It's not large, but it provides
good shelter from the sun, wind and rain. The tent is sparse, made of only as
much material as necessary so that it can be taken down and carried in a pack.

   This is a small shelter made from a rock outcropping on the hillside and
protected from the wind by a mat of debris. It's small and it's not very com-
fortable, but it's still shelter.

   This small cave looks like it was originally hollowed out by an animal, but
it's large enough for you to stand. A fallen rock covers most of the entrance
and protects you from the elements. The ground isn't comfortable, but it's still
a safe place to stay.

   Whatever this building used to be, it is in ruins now. The walls no longer
offer any real protection from the elements, and the piles of debris are
infested with rats. This is the sort of place that attracts trouble.

   The tunnel is cold and damp, but is the fastest way from one side of the
mountain to another. A rat scurries past you, but you ignore him. It's
rumored that giant snakes reside in the mountains and you'd like to avoid
meeting one of them.
