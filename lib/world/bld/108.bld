   This small building is made from finely stained wood, and expertly thatched.
This entryway is cozy and well-trafficked, with the worn floors suggesting this
is a very busy place. It sounds like the people who work here are quite busy.

   This small cave would be easy to miss from a distance, if not for the light
spilling out of it. The floor has a walkway made from wooden planks, and it
looks like someone has been building a shop in the back.
