   The stories scarcely do it justice; this is the Tower Skycleave, the Black
Tower, a place of legends. The impossibly large foyer is somehow merely the
entrance. From the outside, the tower appeared to split the sky in two. Inside,
the high ceilings almost give it a sky of its own.
   A larger-than-life portrait of Grand High Sorcerer Knezz hangs at the head
of the foyer, over a violet fire near the grand entrance. The black paneled
walls and lamp fixtures leave you breathless as the endless room is at once
both dark and light.

portrait knezz larger-than-life~
   The portrait of Grand High Sorcerer Knezz is downright gigantic. Indeed, it
is painted from a low angle, with a great deal of space devoted to his long
salt-and-pepper gray beard, decorated with nocturnium beads. His bushy eyebrows
rest atop thick crescent glasses; his large blue eyes look down at you with an
almost fatherly gaze.

E
north~
The grand foyer is huge. It continues to the north.
