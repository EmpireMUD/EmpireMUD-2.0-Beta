   This carriage is spacious. Every seat is velvet, and the curtains protect
your fine skin from the sun. Truly this is how an emperor was meant to ride:
with all the luxuries and comforts of home.

D
   The walls in this part of the ship are black with soot. It has been
converted into a forge, although the searing hot pit that is used to smelt and
forge metal is far too hot for a ship. Surely it has been enchanted so that the
heroes on this ship have a place to repair their armor.

D
   You have reached the final wagon, which devotes much of its space to
supplies and spare equipment. There is also an anvil and a hot pit that surely
must be enchanted as it is hot enough to melt iron, but cool enough that it
doesn't burn down the caravan.

D
   This grand, well-appointed caravan is made up of a series of wagons. Some
are connected directly, and others have their own team of steeds. This wagon
looks like something of an office, with a box marked 'pigeon mail' and a desk
for writing. Royal curtains hang along the sides of the wagon, ensuring you
never have to see the peasants outside.
