   The vines have recently been scraped away from the walls of this ancient
chamber, revealing ancient, intricate carvings of primitive warriors and
powerful beasts. Torch brackets between the carvings fill the room with a dim
orange light, and the smell of smoke.

   You stand before a great stone gate, permanently open now that whatever
mechanism was used to open and close it is damaged beyond repair. A lighter
patch on the wall nearby indicates that a plaque has recently been removed from

   A wooden boardwalk has recently been built running the length of this
overgrown gallery. The wind makes a faint hissing as it blows through the
remaining leaves and vines on the walls. Several signs warn you to stay off the
stonework, because there may still be undiscovered traps in the area.

   The vines and creepers have been carefully removed from the walls of this
cavernous, torch-lit hall, revealing several massive bas-relief carvings of
ancient jungle deities. Two staircases lead down nearby, but the entrance to
one has been bricked up and surrounded with warning signs. You hear strange
bestial sounds from beyond the wall.

   The stairs are worn away from a steady trickle of water, perhaps from years
of heavy jungle rains since this temple was constructed. The winding stairs
allow little light from the adjoining rooms, and with every second step you
find yourself wiping cobwebs from your face.

   This grand, vaulted chamber is better-preserved than the rest of the temple.
Though its throne suggests it was once a seat of power, looted sarcophagi hint
that it was also used as a tomb. A huge painting of the sun covers the wall
behind the throne.
