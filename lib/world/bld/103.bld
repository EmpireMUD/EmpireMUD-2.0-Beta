   The cave is small and would be easy to miss if not for the scorched
vegetation around it. It looks like something with a hot temper has moved in,
and it might be out hunting nearby.

nest cave~
   This shallow cliffside cave has the remains of a huge nest made of huge tree
branches. Parts of the nest are scorched, but it seems it's been some time
since the dragon was here.
