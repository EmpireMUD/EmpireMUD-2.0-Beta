   Though it's easy to miss at a distance, the entrance to this cave is truly
massive. The cave is dark and you can't see any light coming from the inside,
although the passage is large enough that you could sail a galleon through it.

   The tent is made from red dragon hides, but it could as easily be red from
the blood of animals slaughtered here. There's a pen for fresh animals that's
half in the tent, and half outside. The center of the tent has a roasting pit
and a cooking fire.

   Though it's easy to miss at a distance, the entrance to this cave is quite
large. Someone has built a door just inside, and the landing is decorated like
a front porch. It looks like someone has made this cave into a house. Colossal
claw marks just beyond the porch suggest a dragon once called this cave home.

   This magnificent library is build from red-stained stones, and fabulously
decorated with images of dragons and knights. Sturdy masonry shelves hold
countless books and artifacts, but the centerpiece is a massive dragonquill pen
posed as if writing in a stone book. The back room appears to be an alchemy
laboratory.
