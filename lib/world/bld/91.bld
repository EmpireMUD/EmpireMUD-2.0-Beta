   The tent's walls are a patchwork of tanned and weathered skins which have
been sewn into yards of pliable fabric -- thick enough to protect those inside
from the harsh elements, yet able to be rolled up for lighter breeses to pass
through -- held aloft by a framwork of tusks into a 12' x 14' space.
