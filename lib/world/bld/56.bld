   This is the armory, a large store room of arms and armor. Its primary
function is to supply the empire with the best armaments available. The
armory is slightly run-down as it's not the top priority for repairs. Often,
the armory is run by an artisan of the trade.

   The wooden walls are laced with metal and stained a rich brown in this
bedroom. It's roomier than you would expect, even for a structure like this,
and it makes you feel at home as you bask in the warm glow of the wood. The
scent of fresh pine still emanates from the walls.

   You are standing in a small room which is heated to well over any bearable
temperature. A large oven against the wall is used to heat metal to a
controlled temperature so that a master craftsman can hammer it into a useful
shape. The metal is then cooled in water.

even be built. The thrones themselves are set at the top of a small mountain
of stairs, placing the king high over his subjects. The entire room is plated
with magnificent armor and gold highlights.
