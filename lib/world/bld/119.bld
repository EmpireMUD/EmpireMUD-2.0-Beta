   The cold stone walls of the mausoleum block virtually all light and sound
from the outside world, giving the small tomb a serene sense of everlasting
rest. A single catafalque rises from the floor; this resting place was made for
just one person.

catafalque~
   The rectangular stone catafalque occupies much of the space in the small
tomb. A shallow impression is cut into its surface to keep a body from rolling
off as the mausoleum walks.

   The first floor of the tower is set with plush chairs and a small tea table,
like a cozy parlor. If not for the slighty rocking motion, you could hardly
tell that the tower stands on two legs. A spiral staircase twists up to the
second floor. The walls are set with small windows that let you look out and
there is a door that leads back outside.

   The wooden stairs rise up to a narrow walkway that links the workshop on the
west side of the tower with the bedroom on the east side. Windows along the
round tower walls let you look out to the surrounding countryside -- especially
important if you want to try to drive the tower from here.

   The cozy bedroom has sheer curtains draped over the window that filter the
harsh light of the outside world. Much of the room is taken up by a bed of
downy violet feathers. As you lie on them, you feel weightless and unburdened.
You notice the ceiling is painted like the night sky, with clouds that drift
slowly across it as they change into new shapes.
~

curtains sheer~
   The sheer curtains give the bedroom a rosy glow. Type 'look out' to see out
the window.
~
E
bed~
   The bed appears to be no more than a box of loose down, though when you lie
upon it, you don't seem to touch the feathers at all. Instead, you find
yourself hovering just above them, weightless and free.

The downy feathers on the bed have a pale violet color.
~
E
ceiling sky starry~
   The ceiling is painted with a starry night sky that seems to twinkle as you
stare into its infinite depths. Clouds drift across the ceiling, though they're
painted on, slowly changing from shape to shape.
~

clouds shapes~
   You watch as painted clouds drift across the starry ceiling. They change
shape as they do, sometimes forming a bunny, a sailboat, or even a tower.

   Though you can barely squeeze in, the workshop is well-equipped with all
manner of alchemy materials and magical tools. A tiny oven sits on the counter,
beneath a heatless elemental burner. Behind the clutter, you can see out the
window, but just barely.
