   The gigantic nest is made from whole trees, some of which are so exotic that
you've never even been to the land they were collected from. It looks like you
can 'enter the nest' and see what's in there.

   Exposed gears and power shafts line the walls of the small but luxurious
captain's cabin on the flying clockwork roc. The rich wooden floors vibrate in
the wind as the roc flies, but the machinery is strangely soothing.

   The back room of the clockwork roc is filled with bird cages, featuring
everything from albatrosses to woodpeckers. An agitator is linked to the cages
from one of the gears that lines the walls, and periodically stirs all the
birds into flight for reasons unknown.

   You stand inside a magnificent, massive dome. Beautiful tiles in all colors
cover every square inch of the dome, forming mosaics the size of manor homes.
Much of the floor is empty space, giving priest and pilgrim alike room to lay
down and appreciate the greatness of the dome high above.

mosaics tiles walls~
   The walls are covered with huge mosacis. Some depict great battles, while
others are religious scenes and legends. At the top, the walls come together in
the great dome, which depicts a massive, rust-colored bird: the roc.
