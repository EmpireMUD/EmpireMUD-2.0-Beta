forge, smelt~

   Though this smithy is little more than a facade built over a cave in the
mountain, the magma chamber below makes this the perfect place to smelt the
hardest metals, and forge the strongest armors. Thick sulfuric smoke spews from
holes in the floor and vents through specially-made chimneys.

   The entrance to this cavern is so small you could miss it, and the cavern
itself is barely large enough to hold two men. Chalk art on the walls suggest
this must be the burial place of a great hero.

It looks like someone drew the story of a hero's epic birth, rise, and fall.

   The crypt is dry and frigid, and nestled just below the clouds. This stone
crypt sits so high on the mountaintop that it can be seen for miles in every
direction. Surely whoever is buried here has brought glory to the empire.

   Carved from the mountain itself, this greathall is adorned with all the
splendor of a mountain king. You cannot tell how deep the hall delves into the
mountainside, but the shafts of light that cut through the ceiling hint that
this place is astonishingly large.

   This garrison is spartan, carved into the mountainside with little more than
stone alcoves to house its soldiers. Still, for a mountain empire that must
always be at the ready, it provides a warm home for the soldiers.

   This cozy lodge is built into the mountainside, like a wooden facade
extending from the stone. It's cold up here, but the lodge traps warm air
enough that as you look out the window, the only chill you feel is from gazing
at the snowy mountaintops.
