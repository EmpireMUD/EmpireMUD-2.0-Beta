   You are sailing on the endless ocean, rippling in the wake of the ship. The
water stretches from horizon to horizon, all the way around the ship. Any land
is still too far away to see, banishing any hope of finding shore.

   You have climbed down the ladder from the trap door in the tavern. This room
is surprisingly large for one so well hidden. The walls are wood and trimmed
with gold -- or at least, it looks like gold. The walls are decorated with the
emblems of different kings. These aren't kings that rule here, but those who
have been duped by the building's cunning owners. This is a thieves' den.

   From the top floor of the tower, you can look down over the world, as the
sorcerers who live here like to do. The walls are lined with heavy bookshelves
and packed full with ancient volumes, but it's not so cramped as the first
floor was. Glass display cases show the trinkets and trophies of the tower's
powerful occupants, and a winding staircase leads back to the ground floor.

has taken on a foul odor, perhaps because there isn't a bath.

   This part of the wagon is cozy, almost cramped, due to the upholstered

the wagon so that it doesn't shift in transit, but you can't imagine trying to
sleep while it's rattling over the open plains.
