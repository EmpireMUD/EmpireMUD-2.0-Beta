assassins because the long, hollow fang is perfect for delivering venom.

this bow ensure a truly wicked amount of damage. The name 'Hexerei' is

mana core. Shadows drip from every edge of the shield, and attacks that hit it

slip them on. But you also can't shake an uneasy feeling at what the gloves are

attached to a stick by a leather rope. The size and the, er, quality indicate
that it's goblincraft. Some sort of enchantment is making it feel warm,
although for a goblin weapon that's not necessarily good.
