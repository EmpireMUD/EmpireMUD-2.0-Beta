tongue hydra intact~
an intact hydra tongue~
An intact hydra tongue is coiled here like a spool of rope.~
   A rare thing, an intact tongue from a dead hydra. Most often, they mangle
it with their serrated teeth in their death throws. You can use this to bind
bones together and build an oceanic tower.
