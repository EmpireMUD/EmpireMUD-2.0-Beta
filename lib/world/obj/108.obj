clock mechanical ornate~
an ornate mechanical clock~
An ornate mechanical clock is sitting here.~
   This odd device is what Horation calls a "clock", perhaps in reference to
the tiny bells at the top that ring out at the start of each hour. The clock
has an intricately-carved wooden case, and the clock face is inlaid with
precious metal. Unfortunately, you don't know how to read the clock face and
cannot use it to determine the time.
