honeycomb comb~
some honeycomb~
Some honeycomb is dripping on the ground.~
   The honeycomb looks very fresh. You could eat it, though it's not very
filling, or you could cook with the honey from it as a sweetener. You'll get
back the wax from the honeycomb if you use it for this, or you can 'craft
beeswax' to discard the honey and just keep the wax.
