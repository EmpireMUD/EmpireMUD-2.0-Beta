a vial of pungent red herbicide~
A vial of pungent red herbicide is lying here.~
   It looks like the herbicide has aged nicely and turned the bright red shade
described in the recipe. The smell is too noxious for you to stand, so the vial
is securely corked.

the druid's dirty laundry~
The druid's dirty laundry is lying here.~
   Aha! You've found the head druid's dirty laundry, and this robe clearly
belongs to the High Order of Sorcery -- city wizards! They're no allies of the
druids, and if the head druid is actually an imperial sorcerer in disguise,
this is valuable information indeed.

lava flow burning bright red air hot~
the burning lava~
The hot air waves above the bright red lava flow.~
   The lava flow is fresh enough that it is still moving, although the top is
starting to crust over. It burns you even to stand this close, and your skin is
starting to blister.

lava cooling veins~
the cooling lava~
The veins of lava have begun to cool and harden.~
   The lava flow has cooled enough that it is no longer moving, and is only
warm to the touch. It looks like the whole mountain has taken on a fresh, black
coat of volcanic rock.
