coin watcher~
a watcher coin~
A watcher coin lies hidden on the ground.~
   This odd iron coin depicts only a veiled eye, and only on one side. The
reverse side of the coin is blank. No writing or value is marked on the coin.
The coin reminds you of the sort used by a certain shadowy guild to watch the
activities of its members. Perhaps its purpose is to track your progress as a
master pickpocket.

stone peeping blood-red bloodred red~
a blood-red peeping stone~
A blood-red peeping stone is lying here.~
   The odd gem is no larger than your eyeball, flat, and blood-red. It isn't
cold, nor is it warm. It doesn't feel like anything in your hand. When you hold
it up to your eye, people take on a faint outline.
   Type 'peep <person>' to find the right citizen to become your minion. Once
you find them, type 'minionize <person>' to complete the process.
   Many vampires find a loyal minion crucial for survival.
