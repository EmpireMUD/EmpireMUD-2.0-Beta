an unattuned skystone~
An unattuned skystone has been dropped here.~
   The palm-sized stone is smoothed and polished like river rock. It has a
soft, milky light blue color that almost seems to glow in even the slightest
bit of light.
   Skystones can be attuned in the Tower Skycleave and, once this complete, the
tower will trade them for rare items, designs, and patterns. Each successful
attunement will take more skystones than the previous one.
   The true power of a skystone comes from its attunement to a person's soul or
natural essence. The attunement spell is nearly impossible to cast because a
sorcerer's own soul too easily taints the magic and spoils the attunement.

is stamped into the top.
   A pasty is a portable meal made from mutton, potato, turnip, and onion,
wrapped in a pastry shell and baked until golden. Once the traditional meal of

exotic turquoise cheese~
Some exotic turquoise cheese has fallen here.~

pattern not unlike the stripes of a tiger. The yellow part is firm, almost
bouncy, while the turqoise streaks are soft enough to spread. The cheese is
carved with a logo of a goat's head.
   Rumors circle in the Tower Skycleave of unstable experimentation with live
animals, something usually seen as the vulgar purview of nature magic. Some
sorcerers are eager to create new products or conveniences, with little regard
for traditional ethics. And none of them are afraid to mislabel a product.

   You can 'use' this trinket to find your way back to Skycleave. If you're
close enough, it might even teleport you to the foyer.
   The Tower Skycleave has gone through many forms over the centuries, from
its earliest wooden tower to the magnificent stone structure of today. The

itself. Perhaps they've found a way to grow rocks in this shape?
   You can 'use' this warpstone to teleport yourself to the Tower Skycleave,
even from across the world, though it doesn't seem to have enough power to
perform this amazing feat very often.
   The black tower is known to house a truly priceless amount of magical power,
but its masters manage to put a price on it nonetheless. And as the key to
selling magic is bringing in customers, the tower has devised many clever ways
to bring people back over and over again.

   The Tower Skycleave is home to a great many wonders, which it proudly shares

   Pixy jars were first created by Grand High Sorcerer Kofi, who preferred
glass. But sorcerers preferring not to see the little creatures banging against
the glass as they tried to break free and eventually clay jars took over. Kofi,
in a violent stroke of irony, was felled by pixies in the end.

A torn and tattered page is lying here.~
   The paper itself is old and fragile, damaged not just at the bottom and
left, where parts are missing, but also along the edges. It reads, in part:

   ...cking Gobbrabakh of Orka again. Why is it every time I grasp at the dream
of escaping this ill-fated tower, I find myself knee-deep in somebody else's
problem. No time for any of that, ironically.
   Have been through these events 2413 times, give or take a missed tally, I
find little hope remains for a way out. How foolish I feel that I spent that
full week devising a way to bind myself to this wretched loop in hopes of
breaking it, only to spend six years failing to find the exit.
   My last fading hopes are extinguished as the well of knowledge that was once
the Tower Skycleave has run dry. None of their countless books has a spell to
break free; I have read every one. No history here written explains how these
fools have come to be stuck in the first place. No interview has proved
fruitful; if any of them knows anything, it cannot be prised from their minds
before the loop begins again.
   Well, no way to break free and tell the tale. The lich, Scaldorran, has
instructed me in the creation of a poison, of pixy origin in ages past, capable
of killing a man's soul.
   Surely that will free me from this endless living nightmare. With apologies
to my dearest Em.

none were to be found. On my seventh journey I began experimenting and

itself in one of the pots of paint that sit on the floor.

celiya canvas unfinished current sorcerer grand final~
   At the end of the walkway, just before the stairs, Grand High Sorcerer
Celiya's half-finished likeness is the last -- and latest -- portrait in the
sequence. An enchanted paintbrush pirouettes across the canvas, stopping only
to dip into one of the pots of paint on the floor below it. Miraculously, none
of the paint seems to drip on the pristine floor.
   Though the portrait is still rough, Celiya's form is already taking shape in
a pose that's almost grandmotherly, as if she's welcoming you in from the cold.
The exaggerated cloud of white hair around her head nearly fills the top of the
frame; also exaggerated are the twirling stripes of black and gold in her hair,
far more intricate than the colors Celiya has recently added.
   Below the sorcerer's round, brown, motherly face, most of the portrait is in
shades of violet, unfinished but surely depicting Celiya's flowing robes. The
background, too, is unfinished, but the shining new nameplate reads:

a giant next to the tower. The expression on his face is serene and confident.
The nameplate below the portrait reads:

   A golden liquid shines through the black glass phial, catching any stray ray
of light and sending it back out twice as bright. On the side, the Tower
Skycleave's logo is etched into the glass.
   "Quaffing this phial will grant you the long-lasting night vision you need
to deal with the nocturnal threats that plague our times," according to the
paper tag.
   The sorcerers at Skycleave have sold a great variety of products over the
years in their unending search to create the simplest, most marketable magical
products money can buy. In an era of desperately short life expectancies, the
sorcerers were surprised to find a strong market for potions of great duration.

carry all of life's burdens," according to the paper tag.
   The flowing robes at Skycleave disguise the sheer number of trinkets, tools,
and tidbits the sorcerers carry on their persons. A combination of spells and

weight.

A shadowy puzzle box lies on the ground.~
   As you touch the strange shadow box, your head is filled with images of
a pitch black, freeze-you-to-the-bone winter night. Though it's not large, the
box is lighter than it looks. But as it drains all heat from your fingers, it
seems to grow heavy, and its square sides begin to grow with pale blue lines
like intricate filigree. This is the Moonshadow Configuration, the puzzle box
that holds the key to the dark gate of the shadow realms.
   Use the Moonshadow Configuration to gain a minipet from the elemental plane
of shadow.
   The Shadow Hide plumbed the darkest depths of the shadow realm. It was one
of only two places she ever felt at home. Her mastery over the darkness was her
path to power and prestige, and in her unwavering determination, she left her
the timidness and humanity of her youth in the shadows.

   You turn the little shard over and over in your hands, watching light catch
and refract through it like a milky gemstone that has captured a rainbow. As
you do, a thin prismatic blade slides forward then retreats; the gem then
flattens like a yarn shuttle; then it seems to form a hammer. This clever
little innovation will make crafting a breeze!
   Waltur eventually grew impatient with having to set down and pick up tool
after tool after tool, and began inventing his own.

a magichanical tedium shard~
A magichanical tedium shard is lying here.~
   The odd little tool is made of many layered and folded sheets of metal that
fit together so tightly it can be placed in a pocket. But with a shake, the
tedium shard unfolds into an axe, shovel, scythe, saw, and more! If only you
could afford enough of these to equip an empire, it might rule the trade world.
   Inspired by the popularity of his own crafting shard, Waltur began creating
new tools for an eager market.

bell mausoleum walking~
a walking mausoleum bell~
The bell from a walking mausoleum is lying here.~
   This gleaming iron bell intones a mournful knell when struck. It has been
cast with intricate lettering and images all along its circumference. You can't
read the writing (and there is a lot of it) but the images seem to be
instructions for building a walking mausoleum.
   This bell allows you to build a walking mausoleum. It requires a level 150
Architect and must be built at a carpenter. Afterwards, lead the mausoleum to
move it.
   When Waltur Wright came to Skycleave, it was as a refugee, having fled his
master's cartwright shop in the dark of night. His skill with a hammer was
measured below only his skill with a staff and his ceaseless imagination. Soon,
the wise professors of the black tower put him to work using all three.

effigy sorcery tower walking~
a walking sorcery tower effigy~
An effigy of a walking sorcery tower is lying here.~
   The stone effigy is in the shape of a sorcery tower with long legs -- a
curious sight, to be sure. It's complete with a little door and tiny windows,
through which you can see a tiny cluttered workshop and an enchanting little
bedroom, both carved from stone.
   This effigy allows you to build a walking sorcery tower. It requires a level
150 Architect and must be built at a carpenter. Afterwards, enter the walking
tower and drive it out of the carpenter. You can drive it from any interior
room; look out a window to see where you are.
   The Tower Skycleave has existed in many forms over the years, from Abaris's
original clay brick tower to Wong's legendary stone tower. When he arrived at
Skycleave, Waltur had the same dream: to build a greater Skycleave; one that
the world would never stop talking about. When he became Chief Magineer, he
immediately set to work building prototypes for a new tower.

the cornerstone of a hanging garden~
The cornerstone for a hanging garden is sitting here.~
   The cornerstone is inscribed all over with symbols and words, the language
of which has never entered your ears. Every inch of it has been meticulously
carved with the spell, purportedly to create water from the air. The stone
itself is pale blue, almost gray, nearly translucent, and lighter than it
looks.
   This cornerstone allows you to build a hanging gardens in your city.
   Long inspired by the historical hanging gardens of Sennacherib and the
mythological hanging gardens of Babylon, the magineers of Skycleave set out to
replicate the majestic site.

The crystalline dew of Tagra Nes has been left here.~
   This enchanting little vial of dew is carved from a pale green gemstone.
Every inch of it has been incised with intricate woodgrain patterns and tiny
flowers. There's no lid, but the dew inside flows so slowly it can scarcely
spill.
   Drinking this rare dew before bed is said to carry a slumberer away from
their cozy bedroom to the shared memory of Smol Nes-Pik, a magnificent city now
lost to time.
   The great tree, Tagra Nes, once drew mana from deep beneath the world. But
long was it sapped by Smol Nes-Pik, and long did languish in their care, until
it was rendered into lumber by a wizard of budding renown.

The jade tear of Gobbrabakh of Orka has been left here.~
   The jade tear is a thin, rough-cut, square piece of jade. Its milky green
color is translucent when you hold it up. Though it's the size of a coin and
perhaps somewhat precious, no markings are engraved in it to show it was ever
used as currency.
   Use the jade tear before sleeping in your cozy bed and share the memory of
Gobbrabakh of Orka, a city now lost to time.
   Goblins once believed they were cut from jade in the beginning and it was to
the jade they planned to return. When one of their people died, jade tears
would be placed over their eyes to guide them to their ancestors.

ivory lettering in an ancient language you can't decipher. The writing covers
all visible portions of the desk, perhaps as an enchantment to protect the desk
or tower. The nameplate on the desk, also made from ivory, displays the full
name and title of Grand High Sorcerer Jozef Anton Knezz, Fifteenth Master of

archway behind her exposes a workshop with a mob of household items all
clattering their way through it. Brooms, candlesticks, buckets, floating rugs,
and even a desk are making their way to the portal and seem to be in hot
pursuit of the young woman. Text at the bottom reads:

water -- anything from horses to what look like large cats chase one another
around and around. The oddest thing about them is that they are all made of
water. Every once in a while, one or more of the animal shapes will leap into
the air and escape the confines of the fountain for a time, before returning to
splash into the water and disappear.

   You watch as the ashes whip themselves into a tall column, only to dissolve
again and fall into a pile, before raising themselves up and burning themselves

   You can 'use jar' to gain the little pixy as a minipet.
   Skycleavers have long kept pixies, one of the few naturally occurring
magically-attuned creatures, for use in advanced magic. Pixies were notoriously
difficult to contain until the sorcerers discovered a form of clay through
which mana has been drawn over a long period of time. This clay, when fired,
can hold even a pixy queen.

A shimmering silk suit hangs effortlessly on the air.~
   The dark suit is made from the finest silk and when it catches the light,
rainbows swirl across it like oil in a puddle of water. It has been tailored so
carefully you can see not a single stitch or thread, even when you pull at the
seams. The cut of the suit is sleek and androgynous, and though the foreign
style is hard to place, this suit would turn heads in any court with its
shining gold embellishments.
   This suit grants a new 'bow' social to the wearer.
   As the golden age of Smol Nes-Pik was tarnished into rot and ruin and the

the canopy of any great tree, embellished with golden needlework in the shape
of leaves.
   This suit grants a new 'dance' social to the wearer.
   Fine clothing such as this were common at all levels of Smol Nes-Pik, woven
by artisans born and raised on the great tree, and from silk spun in its crown.
The green dye was sourced from the tree's very sap. Wearing the tree, as it was
sometimes called, showed both pride and piety.

robes lich tattered~
tattered lich robes~
Some tattered lich robes are hanging here.~
   These robes are tattered and torn, and it will surely make you look like a
lich to wear them.
   These robes grant a new 'greet' social to the wearer.
   Liches are born when a great sorcerer dies, as the impression they made in
the magic of the fabric of the world does not easily fade. A lich is,
therefore, not exactly the sorcerer, nor is it a ghost. It is something new,
something different; something not shackled by the doubts or mores of mankind.

robes set page~
page robes~
A set of page robes is lying on the ground.~
   These plain jute robes are commonly worn by Skycleave pages. They spare
hardly a stitch for fashion or embellishment. Like a monk's robe, they
advertise only humility and low station.
   These robes grant a new 'nod' social to the wearer.
   The Tower Skycleave employs a great number of pages, many of whom possess no
magical talent to speak of. Instead, the pages usually rely on enchanted
trinkets to simplify their work.

apprentice robes~
A set of apprentice robes has been left here.~
   The layered cotton robes are airy and light, though the workmanship on them
suggests they were made at low cost. The layers are made in various shades of
white and gray, with simple stitching on the seams and hems.
   These robes grant a new 'shrug' social to the wearer.
   The Tower Skycleave invests a great deal into its apprentices and saddles
them with the highest expectations. Every high sorcerer in the tower began
their storied career as an apprentice who outshone their peers, the more
disappointing of whom now line the tower's cupboards and cabinets.

A goblin has left its vest here, perhaps.~
   This vest is small, and slightly too snug. Nevertheless, those tiny green
fingers make fine clothing.
   This vest grants a new 'tap' social to the wearer.
   No goblins that has entered Skycleave has ever left again. The sorcerers can
little comprehend why, then, the goblins continue to invade it.

a glimmering doublet~
A glimmering doublet is lying on the ground.~
   The doublet is close-fitting and brilliantly embellished with hazel leaves
set against a background pattern that reminds you of bricks. The garment shines
in every color, all at once.
   This doublet grants a new 'wave' social to the wearer.
   The Tower Skycleave creates a fashion craze from time to time because what
seems to be magical, impossible clothing is a simple feat for such powerful
sorcerers. Before long, the villagers usually realize the clothing is gaudy and
impractical. But not before emptying their purses for it.

seedling stone striped~
a striped stone seedling~
A striped stone seedling has been dropped here.~
   This little stone statuette is expertly carved, with long stripes cut into
it to resemble the wood of a calamander tree. The seedling is fragile and cris-
crossed with cracks that glow with a faint brown light. There's serious magic
at play here.
   According to instructions etched in the bottom of the seedling, if you
'smash' it in a jungle, the magic will take root and transform the jungle into
enchanted calamander trees. Be sure to claim the tile first -- and keep it
claimed.
   Calamander forests are cultivated by certain schools of sorcery because the
bicolor wood excels at focusing and amplifying raw mana.

A clingy cloak has been left here.~
   This cloak seems to have attached itself to you without your permission.
Fortunately, it no longer seems to be under the effects of the anthropo-
morphosis spell.
   The cloak will vanish as soon as you take it off.
   Clingy cloaks were originally envisioned as a rescue tool for villagers lost
in the wilds. The cloaks are flung from the top of Skycleave, whereupon they
seek out any uncloaked person and wrap them tightly. Unfortunately, they
turned out to be unsafe for children.

some striped twigs~
Some striped twigs have been piled here.~
   Anywhere the bark has fallen off, these twigs appear to be striped in black
and brown. Surely they come from a luxuriously expensive tree, but in this form
they have little value but as plant fiber.
   The wood of the calamander is used mainly for ornaments and furniture as its
stripes create a truly unique look. The stripes also form near-perfect conduits
for raw mana, making the wood valuable for mages as well.

a calamander tree~
A huge calamander tree is lying here.~
   The tree is relatively non-descript, with rough gray-brown bark of little
interest. All of this belies the fantastically valuable lumber inside.
   Calamander trees are renowned for their supremely expensive striped black
and brown wood. As rare as it is beautiful, calamander can only be found in the
most remote jungles.

   This fine calamander pillar has been scraped and polished to show off the
striped black and brown wood for which the tree is world-renowned.
   The Tower Skycleave features several fine pieces of furniture crafted from
fine calamander wood. The high sorcerers often store spare mana in the wood.

Some calamander magewood boards are stacked here.~
   The boards bear a distinctly variegated pattern of black and brown wood
running their full length. Though it's rarely seen in large-scale construction,
a collection of calamander trinkets is a conspicuous way of showing off wealth.
   Calamander is an outrageously expensive wood due to its distinctive
appearance. It is exceedingly rare, found only in the most remote jungles, and
it makes the finest woodwork.

sapling calamander fine~
a fine calamander sapling~
A calamander sapling has fallen here.~
   This sapling shows the elegant striped wood of the calamander tree, with
black and brown colors that appear when you start to shape it into a haft,
shaft, or handle. It would also make a beautiful fence, but it's far too rare
to waste on that.
   Though calamander is a naturally-occuring tree, rumors abound of its
supposed creation by various mages and sorcerers. One, in particular, made the
mistake of saying 'If I didn't create the calamander, let me be turned into
one here and now' in the presence of a Stone of Truth.

   Though no cheese truly grows from a plant in nature, the magineers at
Skycleave have been extraordinarily successful at grafting unusual foods onto
magical trees.
