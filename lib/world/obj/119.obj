skystone stone unattuned~
an unattuned skystone~
An unattuned skystone has been dropped here.~
   The palm-sized stone is smoothed and polished like river rock. It has a
soft, milky light blue color that almost seems to glow in even the slightest
bit of light.
   Skystones can be attuned in the Tower Skycleave and, once this complete, the
tower will trade them for rare items, designs, and patterns. Each successful
attunement will take more skystones than the previous one.
   The true power of a skystone comes from its attunement to a person's soul or
natural essence. The attunement spell is nearly impossible to cast because a
sorcerer's own soul too easily taints the magic and spoils the attunement.

A mug has been left here.~
   This grande ceramic mug is emblazoned with a stylized version of the Tower
Skycleave made from a pair of swooshing vertical blue lines capped in a sort of
wizard's hat and surrounded in a wavy purple line.
   Even after Skycleave became locked in time, the souvenir mugs helped spread
its legend across the land.

A mutton pasty has been discarded here.~
   It's a brown, palm-sized pastry. It's still hot to the touch, perhaps
enchanted to keep it warm. The hazel and wand emblem of the Tower Skycleave
is stamped into the top.
   A pasty is a portable meal made from mutton, potato, turnip, and onion,
wrapped in a pastry shell and baked until golden. Once the traditional meal of
miners across the land, it's now enjoyed mainly in bourgeois cafes and
gentrified food carts.

exotic turquoise cheese~
Some exotic turquoise cheese has fallen here.~
   This cheese is pale yellow in color, striped with bands of turquoise in a
pattern not unlike the stripes of a tiger. The yellow part is firm, almost
bouncy, while the turqoise streaks are soft enough to spread. The label
indicates that the cheese is made from milk from an un-stable, from something
that isn't a cow.
   Rumors circle in the Tower Skycleave of magical experimentation with live
animals, something usually seen as the vulgar purview of nature magic. Some
sorcerers are eager to create new products or conveniences, with little regard
for traditional ethics.

Around the fountain, a long round bench provides ample seating.

dusty rolls of clothing beneath a tarnished metal claw.
   You can 'play' the claw game to win a prize.
   The claw machine was originally built to exploit the sunk cost fallacy and
was merely a sorcery faire exhibit, but when it rapidly outpaced expectations,
it gained a permanent berth in the gift shop.

A skycleaver trinket is lying here.~
   The pale blue stone trinket is shaped to look a little like the Tower
Skycleave itself, with an exaggerated taper to make it look taller. It's small
enough to fit in a pocket, and light enough to carry around as a memento.
   You can 'use' this trinket to find your way back to Skycleave. If you're
close enough, it might even teleport you to the foyer.
   The Tower Skycleave has gone through many forms over the centuries, from
its earliest wooden tower to the magnificent stone structure of today. The
tower's blocks were cut from the powerful standing stones of an unknown ancient
culture.

wax cover is sitting inside the jar, to be used when you catch a pixy and want
to seal it in.
   You can 'catch' a pixy with this jar if you want to train it for the pixy
races in Skycleave.
   Skycleave had long raced creatures of all sizes for entertainment, but in
the end, none is ever faster than a pixy, nor half as portable.

   The polished round clay jar is purple on the bottom half and brown on top,
with the outline of the Tower Skycleave on the side. The top is sealed with a
blue easy-seal wax cover that will allow you to take the pixy out for races at
Skycleave's pixy track.
   You can 'check' this jar to see the status of your pixy. Improve your pixy's
stats by racing it. You can also 'name jar <name>' to give the pixy a name or,
if you're feeling benevolent, you can 'release' it, but you'll lose the jar.
   Pixy jars were first created by Grand High Sorcerer Kofi, who preferred
glass. But sorcerers preferring not to see the little creatures banging against
the glass as they tried to break free and eventually clay jars took over. Kofi,
in a violent stroke of irony, was felled by pixies in the end.

   The cages that line the walls are all empty -- just as well, since they
aren't particularly large or comfortable. Many of the cages are smeared with
something brownish-green, and you try not to think too hard about what it might
be. Chicken bones and scraps of food line the corners of some of the cages, and
the whole room reeks of desperation.

page 2413 of the time-traveler's diary~
A torn and tattered page is lying here.~
   The paper itself is old and fragile, damaged not just at the bottom and
left, where parts are missing, but also along the edges. It reads, in part:

   ...cking Gobbrabakh of Orka again. Why is it every time I grasp at the dream
of escaping this ill-fated tower, I find myself knee-deep in somebody else's
problem. No time for any of that, ironically.
   Have been through these events 2413 times, give or take a missed tally, I
find little hope remains for a way out. How foolish I feel that I spent that
full week devising a way to bind myself to this wretched loop in hopes of
breaking it, only to spend six years failing to find the exit.
   My last fading hopes are extinguished as the well of knowledge that was once
the Tower Skycleave has run dry. None of their countless books has a spell to
break free; I have read every one. No history here written explains how these
fools have come to be stuck in the first place. No interview has proved
fruitful; if any of them knows anything, it cannot be prised from their minds
before the loop begins again.
   Well, no way to break free and tell the tale. The lich, Scaldorran, has
instructed me in the creation of a poison, of pixy origin in ages past, capable
of killing a man's soul.
   Surely that will free me from this endless living nightmare.

   On this, my ninetieth (ninety-first?) voyage through this infernal time
loop, I am astonished to have found myself in a most grueling combat against
Jozef Knezz himself. I thought myself to have searched every rotten corner of
this smol place; plundered every mote of conversation; seen all their was to see.
   More is trapped in the heartwood of time than I had yet realized. What
follows here is my list of foes trapped herein:
   * The pixy queen and her loyal kin.
   * Venjer the Fox and her kin.
   * Kara Virduke, Bleak Rojjer, Trixton Vye, and their like.
   * High Sorcerer Barrosh, not in his right mind.

unusual experiences in this damnable tower to nine. Herein is summarized what
I have found:
   1. Secret passage when one searches behind the goblin cages
   2. The 'Behold, Everything Bagel!' lab -- certainly effective when most of
      those foolish mercenaries can't read
   3. The Elemental Plane of Water
   4. The 'Hundred Thousand Moons' dream (whose dream is this?)

   It was on my sixth hellish voyage through this tower that I realized the
claw game machine changes on each pass. Having learned of its creation by
Scaldorran in the days before he was a Lich, I sought clues in his office, but
none were to be found. On my seventh journey I began experimenting and
eventually found the claw game bound to the fate of four events:
   1. Grand High Sorcerer Knezz's own fate
   2. The Lich Scaldorran's freedom
   3. Use of the secret passage to bypass the pixy maze
   4. Whether or not one tries to play the claw game while it's broken

Every inch of it has been incised with intricate woodgrain patterns and tiny

their cozy bedroom to the shared memory of Smol Nes-Pik, a magnificent city now
lost to time.
   The great tree, Tagra Nes, once drew mana from deep beneath the world. But
long was it sapped by Smol Nes-Pik, and long did languish in their care, until
it was rendered into lumber by a wizard of budding renown.

The jade tear of Gobbrabakh of Orka has been left here.~
   The jade tear is a thin, rough-cut, square piece of jade. Its milky green
color is translucent when you hold it up. Though it's the size of a coin and
perhaps somewhat precious, no markings are engraved in it to show it was ever
used as currency.
   Use the jade tear before sleeping in your cozy bed and share the memory of
Gobbrabakh of Orka, a city now lost to time.
   Goblins once believed they were cut from jade in the beginning and it was to
the jade they planned to return. When one of their people died, jade tears
would be placed over their eyes to guide them to their ancestors.

ivory lettering in an ancient language you can't decipher. The writing covers
all visible portions of the desk, perhaps as an enchantment to protect the desk
or tower. The nameplate on the desk, also made from ivory, displays the full
name and title of Grand High Sorcerer Jozef Anton Knezz, Fifteenth Master of
the Tower Skycleave.

   The painting shows Knezz, Celiya, and Barrosh posing almost comically
together in front of the tower, holding their fingers out like wands, almost
like children playing Wizard Wars. At least, that's what it shows from behind
the desk. From everywhere else in the room, the three sorcerers stand with
their arms around each other's shoulders, with stern, serious faces.

Celiya's desk~
A sturdy mahogany desk stands in the center of the room.~
   The desk is large -- almost too large -- with intricate carvings around the
outside depicting an academy of scholars apparently studying the higher magical
arts. The placard on the desk indicates that it belongs to Celiya, one of the
Tower Skycleave's longest-serving High Sorcerers.

You examine the painting:
   A robed young woman is running down a hallway. Her foot has caught on the
edge of a rug and she's flailing her arms to try to regain her balance. An
archway behind her exposes a workshop with a mob of household items all
clattering their way through it. Brooms, candlesticks, buckets, floating rugs,
and even a desk are making their way to the portal and seem to be in hot
pursuit of the young woman. Text at the bottom reads:
      'Even if you fall on your face, you're still moving forward.'

the hendecagon fountain~
A grand fountain in the shape of a hendecagon bubbles in the center.~
   This eleven-sided fountain is anything but calm and serene. A collection of
small figures can be seen darting here and there across the surface of the
water -- anything from horses to what look like large cats chase one another
around and around. The oddest thing about them is that they are all made of
water. Every once in a while, one or more of the animal shapes will leap into
the air and escape the confines of the fountain for a time, before returning to
splash into the water and disappear.

the ashes of history~
A column of ash twirls and dances in the wind.~
   The low double-beat of a drum follows the pulsating ashes as they twist and
whirl in the wind. This was once the heartwood of time -- the enchanted core of
a great and ancient tree that protected the Tower Skycleave and fueled its
magic. Now, the heartwood is burned.
   You watch as the ashes whip themselves into a tall column, only to dissolve
again and fall into a pile, before raising themselves up and burning themselves
down again, and again, and again.

Fishing, too, can provide enough food for civilization to rise.

A little pixy minipet jar is lying here.~
   The jar is clay, glazed in violet on the outside with a pair of crossed iron
keys painted on the side and a crossed hazel branch and wand stamped in the
blue wax seal on top. The jar jingles when you shake it, then screams. It
sounds like there's a pixy in there!
   You can 'use jar' to gain the little pixy as a minipet.
   Skycleavers have long kept pixies, one of the few naturally occurring
magically-attuned creatures, for use in advanced magic. Pixies were notoriously
difficult to contain until the sorcerers discovered a form of clay through
which mana has been drawn over a long period of time. This clay, when fired,
can hold even a pixy queen.

a shimmering silk suit~
A shimmering silk suit hangs effortlessly on the air.~
   The dark suit is made from the finest silk and when it catches the light,
rainbows swirl across it like oil in a puddle of water. It has been tailored so
carefully you can see not a single stitch or thread, even when you pull at the
seams. The cut of the suit is sleek and androgynous, and though the foreign
style is hard to place, this suit would turn heads in any court with its
shining gold embellishments.
   As the golden age of Smol Nes-Pik was tarnished into rot and ruin and the
last leaves fell from the great tree, Sparo Vehl sat resolute on the obsidian
throne as the beacon hope for her people.

   Brown, beige, and black silk robes cascade over one another, cutting a
thick silhouette as they pad layer upon layer. The silk is quite fine, showing
neither hem nor stitch. Golden threadwork and filigree shape root-like tendrils
around the bottom of the robes, but the torso and sleeves are undecorated.
   When the last of their great trees fell, the tresydions chose to follow them
into history, such is the cost of the vow they once took.

craftsmanship is such that no stitch or hem is visible. The reddish-brown color
is like a clay brick or a tree trunk, and the wide, straight cut of the suit
gives it a strong elegance, like a tree beside a pond.
   When Lotte left Smol Kai-Pik for the first time at the age of sixty-three,
she little imagined the splendor she would find in the world. Nor could she
conceive of the somber truth that she would never return home again.

not a single stitch can be seen. The silk is dyed a verdant green, at home in
the canopy of any great tree, embellished with golden needlework in the shape
of leaves.
   Fine clothing such as this were common at all levels of Smol Nes-Pik, woven
by artisans born and raised on the great tree, and from silk spun in its crown.
The green dye was sourced from the tree's very sap. Wearing the tree, as it was
sometimes called, showed both pride and piety.

   These robes are tattered and torn, and it will surely make you look like a
lich to wear them.
   Liches are born when a great sorcerer dies, as the impression they made in
the magic of the fabric of the world does not easily fade. A lich is,
therefore, not exactly the sorcerer, nor is it a ghost. It is something new,
something different; something not shackled by the doubts or mores of mankind.

   The Tower Skycleave employs a great number of pages, many of whom possess no
magical talent to speak of. Instead, the pages usually rely on enchanted
trinkets to simplify their work.

suggests they were made at low cost. The layers are made in various shades of

   The Tower Skycleave invests a great deal into its apprentices and saddles
them with the highest expectations. Every high sorcerer in the tower began
their storied career as an apprentice who outshone their peers, the more
disappointing of whom now line the tower's cupboards and cabinets.

   The Tower Skycleave creates a fashion craze from time to time because what
seems to be magical, impossible clothing is a simple feat for such powerful
sorcerers. Before long, the villagers usually realize the clothing is gaudy and
impractical. But not before emptying their purses for it.

   This little stone statuette is expertly carved, with long stripes cut into
it to resemble the wood of a calamander tree. The tree is fragile and cris-
crossed with cracks that glow with a faint brown light. There's serious magic
at play here.
   According to instructions etched in the bottom of the tree, if you 'smash'
it in a jungle, the magic will take root and transform the jungle into
enchanted calamander trees. Be sure to claim the tile first -- and keep it
claimed.
   Calamander forests are cultivated by certain schools of sorcery because the
bicolor wood excels at focusing and amplifying raw mana.

   Clingy cloaks were originally envisioned as a rescue tool for villagers lost
in the wilds. The cloaks are flung from the top of Skycleave, whereupon they
seek out any uncloaked person and wrap them tightly. Unfortunately, they
turned out to be unsafe for children.

they have little value but as plant fiber.
   The wood of the calamander is used mainly for ornaments and furniture as its
stripes create a truly unique look. The stripes also form near-perfect conduits
for raw mana, making the wood valuable for mages as well.

black and brown colors that appear when you start to shape it into a haft,
shaft, or handle. It would also make a beautiful fence, but it's far too rare
to waste on that.
   Though calamander is a naturally-occuring tree, rumors abound of its
supposed creation by various mages and sorcerers. One, in particular, made the
mistake of saying 'If I didn't create the calamander, let me be turned into
one here and now' in the presence of a Stone of Truth.
