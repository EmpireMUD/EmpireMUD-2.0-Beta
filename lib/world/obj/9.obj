drill fire~
a fire drill~
A fire drill is lying on the ground.~
   The fire drill is an ancient way to quickly start a fire. It works like an
ordinary pump drill, twirling and untwirling a short rope to spin the drill.
But instead of a hard drill bit, it spins bare wood against a plank to build
friction and start a fire with very little effort. Unfortunately, it doesn't
last very long before too much of the wood has burned away.
