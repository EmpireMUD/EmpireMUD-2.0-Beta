the chains of Anat~
The chains of Anat lie broken on the ground (list, buy).~
   These chains are huge, meant to bind the war-goddess Anat, the most feared
foe of the ancient world. Anat killed men and gods alike as she walked the
world, drenched in blood. Unfortunately, these chains are broken and it seems
she walks the Earth again. Seek out Anat -- hopefully she hasn't gotten far.
