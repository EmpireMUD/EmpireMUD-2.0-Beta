a worn copy of Handril's Instructionary~
A worn old book is lying here.~
   This book has long since lost its gold leaf. The leather cover is faded and
worn, and you can barely make out the words through a fine layer of dust. As
you blow the dust away, a white flame flashes across the cover and sears the
book's name anew. This is The Handril Instructionary: Apprentice to Sorcery,
2nd Edition, Volumes I-II.
