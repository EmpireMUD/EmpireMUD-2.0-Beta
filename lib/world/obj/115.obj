swords bundle guild~
a bundle of Guild swords~
A bundle of Guild swords is lying here.~
   The Guild of Adventurers needs as many swords as possible to support its
adventurers overseas. For complex reasons related to international commerce,
the swords are rather low-quality and will surely need replacing soon.
   This item is used for the 'Supplies for the Guild of Adventurers' event.
Talk to your guildhall superintendant or to Nostrazak the Incautious to
turn in these swords while the event is still running.

A bag of Guild cleansing smudges is lying here.~

to loot so many ancient treasures without them.
   This item is used for the 'Supplies for the Guild of Adventurers' event.
Talk to your local guildmage or umbramancer to turn in these smudges while the
event is still running.

Talk to your guildhall librarian or tinker to turn in this decoy kit while
the event is still running.
