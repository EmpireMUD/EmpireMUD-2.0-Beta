swords bundle guild~
a bundle of Guild swords~
A bundle of Guild swords is lying here.~
   The Guild of Adventurers needs as many swords as possible to support its
adventurers overseas. For complex reasons related to international commerce,
the swords are rather low-quality and will surely need replacing soon.
   This item is used for the 'Supplies for the Guild of Adventurers' event.
Talk to your guildhall superintendant or to Nostrazak the Incautious to
turn in these swords while the event is still running.

a bag of Guild cleansing smudges~
A bag of Guild cleansing smudges is lying here.~
   The Guild of Adventurers needs a huge number of cleansing smudges -- bundles
of powerful herbs -- to dispel curses and repel hexes. After all, it's not safe
to loot so many ancient treasures without them.
   This item is used for the 'Supplies for the Guild of Adventurers' event.
Talk to your local guildmage or umbramancer to turn in these smudges while the
event is still running.

a Guild decoy kit~
A Guild decoy kit is sitting here.~
   The Guild of Adventurers needs decoys like this one to protect its members
from the things that guard ancient hoards and hidden treasures. Unfortunately
most decoys don't survive the process, so the Guild needs a lot of them.
   This item is used for the 'Supplies for the Guild of Adventurers' event.
Talk to your guildhall librarian or tinker to turn in this decoy kit while
the event is still running.

   These blueprints look like they'll let you build 1 'adventurerstatue'. But
pick a good spot for it, because the blueprints crumble after the first use.
