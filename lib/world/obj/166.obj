spirit christmas nostalgic~
a nostalgic Christmas spirit~
A nostalgic Christmas spirit hovers in the air.~
   Christmas is a time that brings back memories, both good and bad. From the
childhood gifts we'll never forget, to the people who we spent those
Christmasses with who are gone. But those are memories of the people we love,
who live in our hearts forever, and a little nostalgia is good for passing the
long winter nights.

a shimmering magewood jar~
A shimmering magewood jar is sitting here.~
   The jar is made from pale blond magewood, with veins of green and magenta
light streaking down it. The jar is closed but a brilliant, shimmering light
seems to be trying to force its way out of every seam.
   Legend says that if you open the jar in an evergreen forest and release the
Nordlys within, the Nordlys will be trapped in the trees and fill them with its
powerful magic. This will only work on Evergreen Forest tiles -- seek the seeds
of pure ice from the Magiterranean to obtain these rare trees. Be sure to claim
the forest, or you risk losing it. Unlike other enchanted forests, this one
won't spread beyond the first tile.
Usage: open jar
