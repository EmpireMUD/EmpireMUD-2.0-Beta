the enormous hole~
There is a rather large hole in the ground. (adventure)~
   There are signs around the hole that it was dug recently. More worrying,
however, is its size. Whatever dug it is larger than a warhorse. Type
'adventure' to see more information or 'enter hole' to go in.

about the floor to the individual strands that seem to have adhered themselves
to every single thing. It looks as if a large fight happened in the lair of a
very furry creature.

a mauled golden fleece~
A mauled golden fleece is lying here.~
   Is this... Could it be... Is it even possible? Is this the sacred fleece of
Chrysomallos? The same fleece that Jason quested for with his Argonauts for
King Pelias? It was lost for so many years, perhaps in the lair of that fur
dragon the whole time. It's slightly badly mauled, but surely that can't lower
the value of a fabled relic, can it?

   You can plant the seed to grow a frost stalk, or it can be brewed into a

   The origin of the hoarfrost-covered seeds is buried in mystery. Some believe
they were stashed underground long ago, when snow covered the entire world.
Others claim the seeds are actually part of a serragon, not a plant at all.

yarn. It doesn't feel like a liquid, even in your warm hands, so you wrap it
into a skein and tuck it away for later.
   The frozen blood could be used to build a 'hoarfrost serragon shrine' where
your citizens can sit in contemplation of the time you saved them from the
fearsome beast.
   In ages past, the hoarfrost serragons were unknown outside the arctic
tundra. Their emergence from the frozen abyssal pits remains a mystery.
