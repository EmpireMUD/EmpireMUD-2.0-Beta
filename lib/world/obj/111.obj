catches the sunlight and emits an ethereal glow. An inlaid filigree of tiny
emeralds wends its way around the stem, vine-like and dotted with blood red
ruby thorns. The inner surface of the cup shimmers in an oily fashion, rainbow
reflections curling in a way that causes ill ease.

   The legacy of the occupant has been completely obscured by the same creeping

black by decaying berries. But its weight is perfectly balanced for use as a

There is a locked hex box in the open sarcophagus.~
   Except for a faint crease an inch from the top, there are no visible seams
in the box's construction, suggesting it was carved from a single piece of
wood. Even between the possible lid and the body, there is no offset of the
grain. There is a small rune in the middle of the upturned face, and a
different image branded into each of the four other visible sides: a mill, a
garden, a stable, and an estate.
