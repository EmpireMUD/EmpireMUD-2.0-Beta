catches the sunlight and emits an ethereal glow. An inlaid filigree of tiny
emeralds wends its way around the stem, vine-like and dotted with blood red
ruby thorns. The inner surface of the cup shimmers in an oily fashion, rainbow
reflections curling in a way that causes ill ease.

There is a locked hex box in the open sarcophagus.~
   Except for a faint crease an inch from the top, there are no visible seams
in the box's construction, suggesting it was carved from a single piece of
wood. Even between the possible lid and the body, there is no offset of the
grain. There is a small rune in the middle of the upturned face, and a
different image branded into each of the four other visible sides: a mill, a
garden, a stable, and an estate.
