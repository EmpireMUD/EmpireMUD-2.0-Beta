A handaxe has been left here.~

be used to cut, slice, and scrape. It's still large, and not very sharp, and
can't be used to chop until it has a handle. From here, you can wield the
handaxe, use it to mine ore, or craft it into a stone axe.

   This gleaming black piece of obsidian has been sharpened through knapping to
form a razor-sharp edge, sharper than any steel. It's far too sharp to use

A tinderbox is sitting on the ground.~
   This tinderbox can be used to light small fires such as torches. The
firesteel wears down over time, and must be replaced periodically. It works by
striking good steel against a piece of flint to produce sparks, which light the
tinder and can be used to light a larger fire. Type 'light <object>' to light
something using this tinderbox.

is large with a flat dish in the center, while the other is small and flat for
grinding by hand. You can 'mill' some items with this, but it will be slower
than doing it in a proper mill building. 'Use' this item to equip it.
