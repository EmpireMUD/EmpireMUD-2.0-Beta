a handaxe~
A handaxe has been left here.~
   This flint handaxe has been chipped and knapped into a rough shape that can
be used to cut, slice, and scrape. It's still large, and not very sharp, and
can't be used to chop until it has a handle. From here, you can wield the
handaxe, use it to mine ore, or craft it into a stone axe.

A sharpened piece of obsidian has been left here.~
   This gleaming black piece of obsidian has been sharpened through knapping to
form a razor-sharp edge, sharper than any steel. It's far too sharp to use
bare-handed, but you could craft it into an obsidian knife, obsidian spear, or
obsidian sword (requires Basic Crafts).

a firesteel and tinder~
A tinderbox is sitting on the ground.~
   This tinderbox can be used to light small fires such as torches. The
firesteel wears down over time, and must be replaced periodically. It works by
striking good steel against a piece of flint to produce sparks, which light the
tinder and can be used to light a larger fire. Type 'light <object>' to light
something using this tinderbox.

a set of grinding stones~
A set of grinding stones are lying here.~
   The grinding stones are used to process grain into meal or flour. One stone
is large with a flat dish in the center, while the other is small and flat for
grinding by hand. You can 'mill' some items with this, but it will be slower
than doing it in a proper mill building. 'Use' this item to equip it.
