the regal girdle of Hippolyta~
A regal girdle is glowing on the ground.~
   This royal belt was made by Ares -- or perhaps by Hephaestus -- and given
out to signify the right to rule. It bestows the ability to make legendary
crafts to the wearer. It is a tier 3 crafting item.

the hammer of Hephaestus~
The hammer of Hephaestus is lying here.~
   While not the original hammer of the God of Smiths, this hammer is a fairly
close imitation. It carries many powerful enchantments to help you in the
forge. This is the tier 3 crafting offhand item, and can also be used as a
tool.
