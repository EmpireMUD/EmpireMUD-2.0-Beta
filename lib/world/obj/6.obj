a strange crystal seed~
A strange crystal seed is lying on the ground.~
   This unusual seed is encased in a shell of clear crystal, and it glimmers as
it catches the light. Legend says that if a sorcerer were to enchant a seed
like this with a prismatic crystal, it would grow into an entire enchanted
forest. To enchant the seed, use 'enchant seed'. This requires Enchant Tools.

A prismatic seed is sparkling in the light.~
   This enchanted seed sparkles with every color of the rainbow. As you stare
into it, you can see the beautiful enchanted forest it will grow into. Now that
the seed has been infused with magic, you need only plant it and use the chant
of nature to bring it to life. Be sure to claim the tile you plant it on, as
powerful necrovandals seek out unclaimed enchanted forests.
