This strange crop is surely the work of the mad druids of the Magiterranean.

the icy star of winter~
The icy star of winter hovers in the North.~
   This tiny, blue star appears to be frozen in a block of ice. Though it seems
to draw heat from the entire room and chills onlookers to the core of their
bones, it is warm to the touch.

the glacial staff of the Maelstrom~
The glacial staff of the Maelstrom whips around in the air.~
   This staff bears the appearance of a column of newfallen snow, though it
holds its form as you touch it. Above it, the air whips itself into a dark
cloud and begins shooting bolts of lightning down into the staff. Are you
powerful enough to channel these bolts?

the glacial staff of the Maelstrom pattern~
The glacial staff of the Maelstrom pattern is lying here.~
   The methods used in crafting and enchanting this staff are natural magic,
anathema to high sorcerers, so normal staffmaking skill isn't required to craft
it. This pattern teaches you to craft a glacial staff of the Maelstrom.

Cold echoes of the future linger in the air.~
   The soft, frozen echoes of off ice give you vague warnings of events yet to
come. As you hold the echoes to your ear, it is as if every moment of combat is
predestined -- and you are the only one who knows it.

A pair of dangling baubles of the eternal sun are lying here.~
   The large, dangling baubles are impossibly light, like sunlight itself.

them. The baubles instill in you the glow of the undying arctic sun in summer.

your fingers as you touch them, but give no discomfort as you place them on

your mind.

A metaimperium amulet is sparkling on the ground.~
   The amulet hangs from a chain of pure imperium, but the amulet itself is
somehow different. Its luster is somehow brighter, in a way that almost
staggers you as you stare at it. It catches the light at every angle, and would
surely distract your enemies if you wore it around your neck.

The frozen heart of the Permafrost is dangling on a chain.~
   This small, ice-cold heart still seems to beat as it dangles at the end of a
golden chain. It's surprisingly light even for its size. As you wear it, you
feel your own veins run cold, and you can see the warm blood of your foes
coursing just beneath their skin.

The celestial locket of the Permafrost is dangling here.~
   This locket feels heavy -- both in your hands and your mind -- like
nocturnium, but the color is far too light. It almost has the color of the
blue, cloudless arctic sky and as you stare into it, you're momentarily lost in
the comforting thoughts of winter.

   This chain of pearls has a frost-blue tint to them, like no other set of
pearls you have ever seen in nature. Gazing upon the pearls sends a chill down
your spine, but actually touching them with your bare skin gives you that warm,
comforting feeling that someone gets just before freezing to death.

The Tome of the Polar Baron is lying on the ground.~
   This heavy book is bound between plates of ice, and its pages are as
delicate as newfallen snow. Scrawled upon its pages is the long, poetic saga of
the Polar Barons, a great lineage of mages from the Permafrost realm of the
Magiterranean. As your hand touches the icy tome, you realize you can draw out
the mana from that arctic dimension.
