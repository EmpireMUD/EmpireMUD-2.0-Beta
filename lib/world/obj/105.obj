A handful of glowkra pods are scattered on the ground.~
   The glowkra are a bright sky-blue fruit that seems to have a faint glow.
You've heard they glow brighter when pickled. You also have a good recipe for
seafood glowkra gumbo that just needs some magenta arrowfish and some rice.
This strange crop is surely the work of the mad druids of the Magiterranean.
