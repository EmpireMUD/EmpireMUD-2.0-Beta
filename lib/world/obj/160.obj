a covered hole~
A mostly covered hole is here. (adventure)~
   A covering of woven grass sits on the ground over this hole, likely to hide
it from casual observation. Looking closer you find markings along the edges of
the hole that are common with goblin construction.

a silver skull~
A skull forged from silver sits here.~
   A skull crafted in great detail out of silver. However, a variety of points
indicate this could be jointed to other things. Perhaps something to keep in
mind going forward.

skeleton crushed~
a crushed skeleton~
A skeleton, crushed from however it died, is laying here.~
   This crushed skeleton is to damaged to be used as a building material, but
it looks like you can use the various tools in a lumber yard to render it down
into useable pieces. Perhaps you should try to scrape or saw it and see what
happens? And of course, you could always light it on fire.

a long bone~
A single long bone rests here.~
   This bone has saw marks at either end. It must be one of the bones sawed
from the crushed skeleton someone left in the lumberyard. Seems it could make a
reasonable replacement for a stick, if just a bit creepy.

   This dragon's tooth is blackened with the necromantic energies that have
been worked through it. Chipped, burned, darkened, and generally in terrible
shape, it still may have a use.
Implant this into mountable creatures to activate the tooth's magic.
