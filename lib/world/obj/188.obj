cage bone~
a bone cage~
A bone cage is lying here.~
   Although it resembles a cage, it's too small to fit any animals. It's made
from bones and has an eerie orange glow. It looks like you need to 'bind' the
spirits of three animals to it and then 'unleash <animal>' or 'unleash cage' to
release one in your city.

a medical report~
A medical report about a victim of the headless centaur is folded here.~
   The medical information makes it quite clear that this particular victim of
the headless centaur isn't going to be making it. As a final act of compassion
for the dying adventurer, build a 'medical tent' at the tomb where he chose to
summon the centaur and failed to defeat it (any cemetery should do). Then
soothe the fallen adventurer into his final rest by playing some music.

A rib cage xylophone has been set up here.~
   This macabre instrument seems to be made from rib bones. On looking closer,
you think they're probably human rib bones and it makes you worry about the
small ones. A few taps at the xylophone release a haunting, ethereal sound.
The music it makes might be macabre enough to make even dead men danse.
   Hold the xylophone and type 'play' to use it.

to make the wearer look like a vulture. Smoked glass lenses block the wearer's
eyes but amplify the impression that you are looking at an enormous bird. It is
said these masks protect you from disease, because birds are commonly known to
be immune to the plague.
