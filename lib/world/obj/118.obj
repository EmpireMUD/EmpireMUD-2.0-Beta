the buffet~
A buffet has been set out on a long table by the wall.~
   The buffet table is loaded with apples, pears, cheeses (both fresh and
foul), crisps, crackers, carrots, cuts of fish and game, brightly colored
birds, and pots set into the table that hold soup. It has an inviting aroma
that feels like it's exactly what you need right now.

bustling shoes~
A pair of bustling shoes seem to be walking in circles.~
   These shoes are made from fine cloth and leather, and bear the imprint of
the Tower Skycleave on the heel.
   The tower is renowned for sorcerers and their apprentices who never tire as
they trudge up and down the tower's long spiral walkway. One thing is certain:
These shoes were made for walking.

an experimental aura~
There's... sort of an aura hovering here.~
   It glows with... something. Surely this experimental aura was cooked up by
the sorcerers of the Tower Skycleave, notorious for its unusual magics and
well-funded research and development.
   Unbridled innovation is the skeleton key to progress -- at least, according
to Professor Scaldorran.

manual user claw machine~
a claw machine user manual~
The user manual for a claw machine is lying here.~
   You flip through the claw game machine's user manual. Most of the book
describes how to repair various issues with the game, and there's also an
entire chapter described to the machine's creation by Scaldorran in the days
before he was a Lich. But by far the most interesting part of the manual is
the chapter that describes how to get each of the specific prizes.
   The fate of the claw game is controlled by just four events when rescuing
the Tower Skycleave: whether or not you save Knezz (&rK&0), release Scaldorran (&yS&0),
use the secret passage on floor 2 (&gP&0), and tried to play the broken claw
game (&cC&0). Each of these tasks must be completed (or not) during the "rescue"
phase of their respective floors.
   Here are the outcomes:
                          &cC&gP&yS&rK&0  loyal footstool
                          -&gP&yS&rK&0  goblin's vest

an everflowing flagon~
An everflowing flagon has been left here.~
   This old silver flagon stands upright on its wide base, with an elegant
handle in the shape of a curved tree trunk. The top is outfitted with a hinged
lid to keep the drink inside from spilling. The side is emblazoned with the
crest of the Tower Skycleave.
   It seems this flagon has been enchanted to refill itself with water over
time. It's also surprisingly heavy for its size, so perhaps the water is just
hidden somewhere inside it.
   The Tower Skycleave hosts a welcome reception in its lobby at all times as
a way of encouraging guests to become clients -- or even patrons. Self-filling
vessels such as this one are difficult to find outside, however, as the
sorcerers usually enchant them to be unpilferable.

place over your eye by a silken sash. The crystal allows you to see what you're
working on at the cellular level. It also seems to sense the heat from living

   The artificers of Skycleave are known to make all manner of useful trinkets,
though most of these are created ad hoc by sorcerers looking to shortcut
whatever difficult task they're working on at the moment.

   Possession of this jar allows you to morph into the following

   Though it has become all-too common for students at the Tower Skycleave,
punitive transformation is nevertheless a longstanding tradition for pupils who

top, it is completely unbranched and flawlessly straight.
   Pixy magic can create true life, even a tree or sapling. But if it dies, the
life that was given returns to the pixy, and the thing's un-nature is revealed
in its death.

A goblin wrangler's whip is coiled here.~
   This long, braided whip is made from a deep green leather. The whip's handle
is relatively small, but its maneuverability allows a skilled wielder to keep
enemies at bay.
   The Tower Skycleave, having long been a prized target of goblin burglars,
began setting traps to capture any goblin who dared enter. But even caged --
or perhaps even moreso when caged -- a goblin is a crafty sort, and it requires
a skilled wrangler to keep them under control.

a goblin wrangler's spear~
A goblin wrangler's spear has been stabbed into the ground.~
   Goblin wrangling is notoriously difficult. This long, thin, finely made
spear is an essential tool for keeping goblins at bay. The spear is made from a
dark black wood and, though it's polished almost until it looks like
nocturnium, it is far too light to be metal.
   Spears such as this are crafted by artificers at the Tower Skycleave, who
have long faced what they euphemistically call "the goblin problem". It's a
common occurrence for goblins to attempt to steal the tower's priceless relics,
so wrangler spears are often stashed around the tower.

fine point that it requires no sharpening. The glass grip of the handle seems
to fit your hand perfectly, such that the hatchet almost becomes an extension
of your wrist.
   Glass is capable of forming an exceptional edge, far sharper than any bronze
or iron, though natural glasses like obsidian are desperately fragile and
ephemeral.

   Magical glass of all sorts were produced at Skycleave under the care of
Grand High Sorcerer Kofi and though the tower no longer manufactures them, the
artificers are still known to shape old glass ingots into tools and weapons
from time to time.

Celiya's warstaff~
Celiya's warstaff has been staked into the ground.~
   This twisting staff has none of the gnarls and knots of other wizard staves
you've seen. Instead, its twists and turns project a sense of soft elegance
through the form of this great warstaff. This staff bears the house emblem of
the great sorcerer Celiya, one of the famed leaders of Skycleave.
   House Traga was established in the Second Age, and though most of its early
history is strictly mythological -- and fantastical indeed -- it has produced
so many High Sorcerers that few question its claims of descent from divinity.

which is both taller than a full-grown man and wider at the top than a cow's
skull, the staff is amazingly light. Veins of red mana skitter up and down the
staff, pulsing like a heartbeat.
   Though many Skycleavers speak of Apollus as a person, in reality the title
refers only to the current holder of the Apollus Chair, the sorcerer who
oversees magics related to disease, poison, and healing.

it's hard to imagine what it might have come from. The entire length of the
club, save for the leather-wrapped handle, is carved in intricate scrimshaw,
depicting the aftermath of a great war. In the scene on the club, a single hero
stands over countless fallen foes, some of whom now serve the hero while others
merely fertilize their fields.
   Carving a great victory -- or defeat -- into the bones of the fallen is an
ancient tradition.

knowledge to understand the meaning behind the carvings, but the pale blue glow

   The goblins have long forgotten the stories of the original rain bows, so
called because they were shot off the gobbrabakhs during the driest months to
strike water from clouds.

   This suit isn't metal, leather, or cloth. It's a material you've never seen
before, other than on the captured otherworlder in the Tower Skycleave. The
material has an iridescent sheen like pearl, but it's as flexible as fine
linen. The armor even seems to heal itself when damaged.
   The otherworlder came on a shooting star so bright that its doom lit up the
night and so heavy it shook every cup from its board for a thousand miles. The
otherworlder's strange tools and inscrutible magics led the Tower Skycleaver to
study him, that they might learn enough to stand their ground if an army of
otherworlders should follow.

holding it together, it seems well-attached. Thin red veins of mana streak up
and down the armor, and they seem to repair it when it's broken.
   Created first as a costume for a Day of the Dead party, the armor took on a
life of its own when an errant spell from Scaldorran brought all the costumes
to life. For his part, Scaldorran insisted he was only trying to liven up the
party.

Heavy steam falls from the bindings as mana seeps out through their tattered

icy magic.
   Skycleave was once home to three great liches -- sorcerers whose power was
so great that the fabric of the world's magic has a deep impression in their
image. For these sorcerers, living in death as a shadow of the spells they wove
in life is still a form of immortality, but few erudite wizards would consider
the lich to be the same person.

A set of Grand High Sorcerer's robes is floating here.~
   These violet robes seem to have a life of their own. When removed, they
stand like a person. When worn, they tug at the wearer's arms and help guide
them as they cast magical spells. Every inch of the robe is embroidered with
threads of gold and nocturnium and though they look as if they weigh a ton,
they feel effortlessly light.
   After Knezz ascended as Grand High Sorcerer, he grew tired of relying on
page boys to help him don his heavy robes. What began as a lazy enchantment to
stand the robes on their own soon became a complex animus spell. Perhaps
thinking himself above casting his own spells, Knezz eventually enchanted the
long sleeves of the robe to move his arms for him as well.

Barrosh's lost grimoire is lying here.~
   This arcane tome is bound in a solid ebony cover, its pages sewn in by
blood-red thread so fine you cannot identify it. Most of the heavy grimoire's
pages are covered edge-to-edge in different scripts and handwritings, perhaps
translating each page from language to language. Of these, you can read less
than half. But the grimoire's power can still be channeled, if you have the
will.
   Barrosh inherited the grimoire, less its current cover, from his uncle,
Barrad. Sorcery came rarely to their line, and it was necessary from the first
generations to commit spells to text to ensure the family's fortune was not
lost.

prism, it splits into beams of every color, from the richest red to the
vibrantest violet. The beams arc around the room, sometimes glancing off a
shiny surface, before focusing back together into brilliant white light that
moves from target to target.
   High Sorcerer Knezz famously used this focus to trace the glimmering light
of a magical beacon to a new source of magewood, helping secure his legacy and
elevating him to the tower's top rank.

From the imprints, you can see that it was cold-worked in the ancient style,
not forged with fire and smoke. The shield is in the shape of a twinkling star,
though its rough finish hardly scatters light.
   On any clear night, shooting stars can be seen across the land. Despite
this, it is exceedingly rare to find the place where one has fallen, making
starmetal one of the most sought-after minerals.

traditional buckler, and someone has managed to stabilize it so that it doesn't
dissipate. A careful glance through the ethereal shield reveals that it also
seems to focus magical attacks cast through it.
   The Tower Skycleave is home to so many rare and precious items that it is
under the near-constant threat of invasion, burglary, and assault. Stabilized
mana shields are de rigueur for the vanguard, which is often full of less-
experienced students incapable of conjuring a shield of their own.

an otherworldly bodysuit~
An otherwordly bodysuit is lying crumpled on the ground.~
   The paper-thin bodysuit has the look of scale armor, with many dazzling tiny
shapes that seem to reinforce it even if they don't make it thicker. Every
square inch of it catches and reflects light like nothing you've ever seen!
   This suit grants new 'applaud' and 'clap' socials to the wearer.
   The Shadow Hide found the otherworlder in the burning wreckage of a round
metal carriage at the bottom of a steep crater. To the erudite lords of
Skycleave, this was an unparalleled prize and it earned her high acclaim.

of the crates are nailed shut. The floor around and under the crates looks

the nocturnium sculpture~
A nocturnium sculpture of a strange creature stands on the dais.~
   The large sculpture in the center of the room looks like it's made of raw,
unrefined nocturnium ore, with chunks of black rock sticking out. In form, it
resembles a hunched person, though it has six arms and indistinct legs. The
lowest pair of arms are thick and rocky, almost resembling muscles, while the
upper four arms are slender and formed from long, twisting cables of wrought
nocturnium.
   If the sculpture was made to resemble a man or woman, you're not sure which.
Its face bears a mouth but no eyes, nose, or ears, though it has been sculpted
to have a thick brow ridge above where the eyes would be.
   The sculpture is warded by a shimmering wall of light that surrounds the
dais and prevents you from getting too close.

Scaldorran's repository~
A rough-worked stone repository is resting on a pedestal.~
   The repository is an old stone oil lamp. Parts of it are so worn as to give
the impression that it has been around since before brass lamps were first
forged. Every inch of the lamp is cold to the touch, yet water never forms on
its sides. In the dark, it almost seems to glow, but in bright sunlight it
takes on a dark, sinister character.
   A lich is made of pure magic, of a sort that would quickly dissipate after
the death of a sorcerer. But when a sorcerer commands vast power and abundant
cleverness, it is possible to prepare a repository to anchor their magic to the
mortal plane after their body has rotted and their soul has moved on.

   These impossibly light, unimaginably thin greaves are molded in the shape of
your shins. The magitanium twists and swirls with iridescent rainbows any time
it can catch even the tiniest glint of light. These greaves are truly a
warrior's dream.
   For a brief time, dubbed "magitanium mania" by High Sorcerer Barrosh, every
pen, clasp, button, and plate in Skycleave was made from magitanium. Still,
among the innovations credited to the Tower, magitanium is the one most valued
by smiths across the land.

inspection, they are made of fine leather that is so dark, you can scarcely see
it. The outside surface is micro-textured with barbules that produce no sound
when rubbed together, while the inside is lined with the finest cloth.
   As a naturally independent but shy child, Niamh was often accused of
hiding from others. Though it was her brother who dubbed her "Niamh the Shadow
Hide", she reclaimed the title for herself at Skycleave.

   These loose-fitting leggings are made from rare, elegant thundersilk -- a
material that channels every stray spark of static electricity in the air
straight into a sorcerer's body to strengthen their offensive magic.
   Thundersilk was once made by pixies, masters of silk, from the coccoons of
moths that pupated at the lightning-kissed tops of the trees. No pixy cities
yet remain that produce it.

from the infinitely dark, unseeable void that lies at the heart of the fabric.
   Soulcloth is meticulously weaved on a splintering loom, usually by a crone.
When the cloth is done, it is boiled along with the weaver in a stone cauldron,
trapping the weaver's soul within. This is considered the greatest honor.

   The sparkling white shinguards are well-molded to fit the fronts of your
legs. They're small, thin, and shockingly light. This is moxteel, a
magic-infused metal that weighs less than any normal metal while deflecting
blows even when they should be strong enough to pierce it.
   Moxteel was a late invention of Skycleave, after the fad for enchanted glass
armor had started to wane.

plates tied together by reinforced leather. The magitanium twirls and spins
with iridescent rainbows when light flickers off of it -- truly a warrior's

   Magitanium is an enchanted metal, usually thought to be an infused form of
imperium, though in reality it has been created from many light metals by the
artificers of Skycleave.

   This infinitely black waist strap is made to protect the midsection of a
thief or assassin while still allowing them the full range of movement. The
shadowhide leather is so dark that it's hard to make out details, but on close
inspection you can see that the surface is covered in tiny barbules that reduce
the sound it makes as it rubs against other pieces of armor and clothing.
   The first shadowhide was made by casting a spell on a pair of melanistic
foxes, shrinking and silencing their plush fur. Soon, Niamh devised a better
technique that worked on common leather and required no wild animal.

pop as you run your fingers over it, leaving red marks on your fingers in the
shape of tiny lightning bolts. Wearing the cincture, you can feel all that
energy channeled into your body -- and your magic.
   The fantastically rare nature of thundersilk owes to the way it is normally
created in small squares that must be stitched together, a trait common to all
pixy fabrics.

impossible to see through it or into the folds. When you try to look, gently
pulling open one of the sash's folds, a hollow and haunting scream escapes from

   Some mageweavers spend their entire careers dreaming of the day they will
make a single bolt of soulcloth, such is the promise of immortality it brings.

A moxteel skycleaver belt is lying here.~
   This plated belt is made from sparkling white moxteel, a magic-infused metal
that can only be worked by a skilled wizard. The moxteel is all but unbendable
-- it would sooner leave an impression in your skin than take an impression of
your enemy's weapon itself. Still, it would be hard for anyone to land a blow
through a belt as well-made as this.
   At its inception, moxteel was envisioned as a seat for gems and jewels. That
is, a material suited to crowns and scepters. When it never achieved the
glister of gold, Skycleave turned to its more practical property and began
working armor from it.

because it's made from magitanium and because of the honeycomb structure
inside, where the magitanium has been shaped to disperse even the most powerful
impacts. As you run your fingers over the wristguard, the iridescent swirls of
the magitanium seem to follow every movement.
   Magitanium originated outside the tower, but it triggered a small feud when
some sorcerers preferred it over moxteel.

Skycleave, the Shadow Hide immediately began infusing it into every jewel,
trinket, device, and creature, and she found a different result with each.

thundersilk is stark white, save for a fair golden sheen that flickers off of
it when it catches the light. You're not sure you've ever seen silk this fine
before.
   The thundersilk moth was once widely herded by pixies in their great tree
cities. There existed a particular technique for unraveling the coccoon while
the pupa slept soundly, able to emerge without cutting the precious silk.

   High Sorcerer Itania, in her travels, traded for many of the artifacts and

powerful wizard to help the bearer of these earrings move faster and more
quietly in battle.
   The Shadow Hide became acquainted with darkness at an early age, learning to
twirl it like ribbons and sculpt it like clay. The two were fast friends, and
each shaped the other.

although you can still see sparks of lightning climbing up and down the
earrings, it doesn't make that characteristic crackle as it does.
   Thundersilk moths are born from eggs laid under the highest leaves of great
trees, where lightning is at its closest. Their caterpillars have furry backs
that crisp and sizzle as stray sparks in the air are caught and channeled.

fortunately, it doesn't let out the ear-piercing wails like ordinary soulcloth

single bolt of the stuff is often split into many smaller pieces, at the cost
of fragmenting the soul held within.

   The process for creating moxteel is tightly guarded by the Tower Skycleave
even after its sorcerers were twice abducted by envious ironmongers who forced
the secret out by nefarious means. Both abductors vanished within a fortnight
of the kidnappings.

peacock golden trense~
the Golden Peacock of Trense~
The Golden Peacock of Trense is sitting on the ground.~
   The peacock is nearly life-size with dozens of paper-thin, jewel-encrusted
tail feathers fanning out over it. Every detail is molded in gold and gems,
from the smallest feathers to the noble grimace on its beak. This is the world-
renowned Golden Peacock, prized heirloom of Trense, envy of the seven baronies.
   The first lords of Trense wore such bright and ostentatious silks that their
peers accused them of peacocking. When Stane of Skour presented a stuffed
peacock to Marquel of Trense and Lady Gorgea as a wedding gift, it was meant as
a slight. But Lord Marquel had the bird replicated in gold and placed above the
mantle.

a handbook of hexes and curses~
A handbook of hexes and curses has been left here.~
   The little red handbook is well-worn. The cover is frayed at the edges and
some pages are missing. The title identifies it as Happy Harpy's Hex Handbook,
with a foreword by Instructor Huberus of Skycleave.
   Huberus was raised by her wealthy uncle after the death of her parents,
though the man had no fondness for children. He sent her to a series of
boarding schools, where she excelled at his great expense.

   Cold shadow pours down from the archway before the stairs. You reach out and

impervious to magic. This powerful shadow magic must be coming from somewhere
nearby.

deconfabulator mana~
a mana deconfabulator~
Someone has left their mana deconfabulator on the ground.~
   The oversized device is bulky and difficult to even lift, though it isn't
particularly heavy. It's made from striped magewood and nocturnium straps, with
a crystal orb on one end and an eventide horn on the other. You don't see a way
to turn it on; or, perhaps it isn't working any more.
   You can 'use' this deconfabulator to cast a temporary counterspell.
   Magical energy, often called mana, is a tangled thing, often tainted by the
stray thoughts and dreams of wizards and sorcerers. Purifying mana is nearly
impossible, but deconfabulating it can be done with the right equipment.

touch, but you can't figure out how to open it, nor what it's doing.
   You can 'use' this condenser to throw it at an enemy in combat.
   Magic scholars have posited that the ether can be used as a source of mana.

A carved wooden man lies on the ground.~
   The angular wooden figurine resembles a man, at least from the waist up;
there are no legs. The figurine's head is bald and the details on the face are
poorly defined, except for a pair of jade squares stuck in for eyes. A
double-chevron collar is the only hint of clothing, but the sculpture has
distinct arms and hands that join near its waist.
   Many cultures practice woodcarving to create ornaments, dolls, and religious
sculptures.

a dynamic reconfabulator~
There is a dynamic reconfabulator on the ground.~
   The odd tool is little more than an oversized crystal ball with a magewood
ring around it and a nocturnium stake through the center. You have no knowledge
of how to use it -- if, indeed, it serves some function or purpose at all. But
you do notice that it's ice cold to the touch.
   You can 'use' this reconfabulator to throw it at an enemy in combat.
   When mana becomes too pure, it sometimes becomes explosive. As this can be a
side-effect of deconfabulation, the proper solution is a reconfabulator.

A prototype for a miniature wellstone is lying on the ground.~
   The odd little rainbow wellstone seems to have been made from a dozen
smaller gems and minerals, as if they were fused together and then carved to
resemble a smooth, round rock, almost like a skipping stone. It seems to be a
prototype; you can't figure out how to make it do anything.
   The magineers at Skycleave design far more gizmos than they ever create.
Some take years of research and experimentation and, of those, many still fail.

A self-writing pen is twitching on the ground.~
   The elegant tower pen is made from black metal, perhaps nocturnium as there
is no sign of rust. The top half of the pen is encircled with magic words you
cannot read, as they scoot around to the other side of the pen whenever you try
to look at them.
   Unfortunately, you can't seem to figure out how the self-writing pen works.
When it's too close to any blank surface, it starts scribbling on its own. But
nothing you do or say seems to control it.
   A good self-writing pen can save a person a lot of time writing class notes,
thank-you notes, and Dear John letters. It perfectly mimics one's handwriting,
though the text is rarely original.

column atop the tower. The heart has a slow, steady double-beat with glints of
red and blue light traveling from the heart to the top of the column and then
back down again.
   Time itself is being drawn up into the heartwood, then echoed back on itself
in an endless cycle. Surely this is what is responsible for the sorry state of
the Tower Skycleave. Your only recourse now is to burn the heartwood in hopes
of ending the cycle and rescuing the sorcerers from this odious time loop.

             Your eyes captivate me like the chandelier; your

glitters in every color of the rainbow as the light strikes it. Nineteen tiny
holes run the length of the flute. It's difficult to play, but the music is
transcendental.
   Hold the flute to play it.
   Joiago learned to play the flute at a young age from his grandmother, who
gifted him one made by pixies in an earlier age. In the right hands, it has the
power to evoke powerful emotions and draw listeners into an enchanted dance.

that could split the hair on a moth. At its base, it swirls into a jade handle
with no seam or joint; the two minerals seem to flow into each other. At the
base of the handle, the knife is finished with opal that equally has no
boundary.

when it catches the light, its lustrous surface shimmers like a pastel rainbow.
   Pearls often symbolize beauty, wisdom, and luxury. But to a person whose
diet is made of shellfish, they can instead represent abundance.

bladder leather~
a leather bladder~
A leather bladder is lying on the ground.~
   The small bladder has been stretched and tanned to make it into a canteen.
No smell remains except the salt of the ocean, but this was once the bladder of
some unfortunate creature. The mouthpiece is kept shut tight by a leather
string tied securely around it, but even when it's closed, it smells of lilac.
   The light, lilac wine, sweet and heady, is said to dull the deep pain of
losing a lover.

rock good~
a good rock~
A good rock is lying on the ground.~
   It's an ordinary, common rock of the sort you find everywhere in the ground.
The rock is unremarkable. It's small, relatively round, not very smooth, and
mostly gray.
   It was once a common tradition for a traveler to pick up a rock as they left
one city and deposit it in a pile in the next city, carrying it with them as
protection on the road.

skystone stone depleted~
a depleted skystone~
A depleted skystone has been tossed aside.~
   The smooth, palm-sized stone has a light blue color to it. It seems to have
lost its luster and doesn't quite reflect light the way most skystones do.
   Skystone attunement causes a terrible strain on the soul or natural essence
of the person the stone is attuned to. The process rarely succeeds at enriching
the stone as the stone's power is easily absorbed by an injured soul rather
than the other way around.

jade blue rough-cut cut piece~
a piece of rough-cut blue jade~
A rough-cut piece of blue jade is lying on the ground.~
   The little stone, smaller than your palm, has a soft light blue color that
glimmers in the light. It looks like it's been cut or split from other rock
and knapped into a rough circle.
   All colors of jade are prized by goblins, light blue most of all for its
resemblance to the sky.
