the buffet~
A buffet has been set out on a long table by the wall.~
   The buffet table is loaded with apples, pears, cheeses (both fresh and
foul), crisps, crackers, carrots, cuts of fish and game, brightly colored
birds, and pots set into the table that hold soup. It has an inviting aroma
that feels like it's exactly what you need right now.

bustling shoes~
A pair of bustling shoes seem to be walking in circles.~
   These shoes are made from fine cloth and leather, and bear the imprint of
the Tower Skycleave on the heel.
   The tower is renowned for sorcerers and their apprentices who never tire as
they walk up and down the tower's long spiral staircase. One thing is certain:
These shoes were made for walking.

manual user claw machine~
a claw machine user manual~
The user manual for a claw machine is lying here.~
   You flip through the claw game machine's user manual. Most of the book
describes how to repair various issues with the game, and there's also an
entire chapter described to the machine's creation by Scaldorran in the days
before he was a Lich. But by far the most interesting part of the manual is
the chapter that describes how to get each of the specific prizes.
   The fate of the claw game is controlled by just four events when rescuing
the Tower Skycleave: whether or not you save Knezz (&rK&0), release Scaldorran (&yS&0),
use the secret passage on floor 2 (&gP&0), and tried to play the broken claw
game (&cC&0). Each of these tasks must be completed (or not) during the "rescue"
phase of their respective floors.
   Here are the outcomes:
                          &cC&gP&yS&rK&0  glimmering doublet
                          -&gP&yS&rK&0  goblin's vest

an everflowing flagon~
An everflowing flagon has been left here.~
   This old silver flagon stands upright on its wide base, with an elegant
handle in the shape of a curved tree trunk. The top is outfitted with a hinged
lid to keep the drink inside from spilling. The side is emblazoned with the
crest of the Tower Skycleave.
   It seems this flagon has been enchanted to refill itself with water over
time. It's also surprisingly heavy for its size, so perhaps the water is just
hidden somewhere inside it.
   The Tower Skycleave hosts a welcome reception in its lobby at all times as
a way of encouraging guests to become clients -- or even patrons. Self-filling
vessels such as this one are difficult to find outside, however, as the
sorcerers usually enchant them to be unpilferable.

place over your eye by a silken sash. The crystal allows you to see what you're
working on at the cellular level. It also seems to sense the heat from living
creatures, granting some degree of night vision.
   The artificers of Skycleave are known to make all manner of useful trinkets,
though most of these are created ad hoc by sorcerers looking to shortcut
whatever difficult task they're working on at the moment.

seal are emblazoned with the coat of arms of the Tower Skycleave. There doesn't
seem to be a way to open the jar, but you can hear beads rolling around inside.
   Possession of this jar allows you to morph into the following

   Though it has become an all-too common punishment for students at the Tower
Skycleave, punitive transformation is nevertheless a longstanding tradition for
pupils who prove disappointing.

blue. Its bark is smooth to the touch and though it has a few leaves at the
top, it is completely unbranched and flawlessly straight.
   Pixy magic can create true life, even a tree or sapling. But if it dies, the
life that was given returns to the pixy, and the thing's un-nature is revealed
in its death.

A goblin wrangler's whip is coiled here.~
   This long, braided whip is made from a deep green leather. The whip's handle
is relatively small, but its maneuverability allows a skilled wielder to keep
enemies at bay.
   The Tower Skycleave, having long been a prized target of goblin burglars,
began setting traps to capture any goblin who dared enter. But even caged --
or perhaps even moreso when caged -- a goblin is a crafty sort, and it requires
a skilled wrangler to keep them under control.

a goblin wrangler's spear~
A goblin wrangler's spear has been stabbed into the ground.~
   Goblin wrangling is notoriously difficult. This long, thin, finely made
spear is an essential tool for keeping goblins at bay. The spear is made from a
dark black wood and, though it's polished almost until it looks like
nocturnium, it is far too light to be metal.
   Spears such as this are crafted by artificers at the Tower Skycleave, who
have long faced what they euphemistically call "the goblin problem". It's a
common occurrence for goblins to attempt to steal the tower's priceless relics,
so wrangler spears are often stashed around the tower.

   Magical glass of all sorts were produced at Skycleave under the care of
Grand High Sorcerer Kofi and though the tower no longer manufactures them, the
artificers are still known to shape old glass ingots into tools and weapons
from time to time.

Celiya's warstaff has been staked into the ground.~
   This twisting staff has none of the gnarls and knots of other wizard staves
you've seen. Instead, its twists and turns project a sense of soft elegance
through the form of this great warstaff. This staff bears the house emblem of
the great sorcerer Celiya, one of the famed leaders of Skycleave.
   House Traga was established in the Second Age, and though most of its early
history is strictly mythological -- and fantastical indeed -- it has produced
so many High Sorcerers that few question its claims of descent from divinity.

which is both taller than a full-grown man and wider at the top than a cow's
skull, the staff is amazingly light. Veins of red mana skitter up and down the
staff, pulsing like a heartbeat.
   Though many Skycleavers speak of Apollus as a person, in reality the title
refers only to the current holder of the Apollus Chair, the sorcerer who
oversees magics related to disease, poison, and healing.

A scrimshawed bone club is lying here.~
   This huge club is made from the bone of an even larger creature, although
it's hard to imagine what it might have come from. The entire length of the
club, save for the leather-wrapped handle, is carved in intricate scrimshaw,
depicting the aftermath of a great war. In the scene on the club, a single hero
stands over countless fallen foes, some of whom now serve the hero and others
merely fertilize their fields.
   It is said one does not attack a feramancer in the field, a phrase oft-
repeated since the Battle of Tuskrun Downs. As the Galradian army cut at his
flanks, the Wildermage Indrik summoned a thousand great beasts, from far and
wide. The earth shook, the Galradians were trampled to dust, and what few
beasts they felled were carved in celebration and honor by Indrik himself.

knowledge to understand the meaning behind the carvings, but the pale blue glow
they emanate in the dark tells you their purpose is to channel mana.
   When he had defeated the Galradian army, Wildermage Indrik carved the bones
of his greatest allies to celebrate the victory they seized from the tusks of
defeat.

you pull on the string you find it sturdy and strong. The only writing on the
bow appears to be the goblin symbol for rain.
   The goblins have long-forgotten the stories of the original rain bows, so
called because they were shot off the gobbrabakhs during the driest months to
strike water from clouds.

   This suit isn't metal, leather, or cloth. It's a material you've never seen
before, other than on the captured otherworlder in the Tower Skycleave. The
material has an iridescent sheen like pearl, but it's as flexible as fine
linen. The armor even seems to heal itself when damaged.
   The otherworlder came on a shooting star so bright that its doom lit up the
night and so heavy it shook every cup from its board for a thousand miles. The
otherworlder's strange tools and inscrutible magics led the Tower Skycleaver to
study him, that they might learn enough to stand their ground if an army of
otherworlders should follow.

run your hand over it. It seems to be real bone and though you can't see what's
holding it together, it seems well-attached. Thin red veins of mana streak up
and down the armor, and they seem to repair it when it's broken.
   Created first as a costume for a Day of the Dead party, the armor took on a
life of its own when an errant spell from Scaldorran brought all the costumes
to life. For his part, Scaldorran insisted he was only trying to liven up the
party.

   These ephemeral garments cling loosely to your skin as you touch them.
Heavy steam falls from the bindings as mana seeps out through their tattered

icy magic.
   Skycleave was once home to three great liches -- sorcerers whose power was
so great that the fabric of the world's magic has a deep impression in their
image. For these sorcerers, living in death as a shadow of the spells they wove
in life is still a form of immortality, but few erudite wizards would consider
the lich to be the same person.

A set of Grand High Sorcerer's robes is floating here.~
   These violet robes seem to have a life of their own. When removed, they
stand like a person. When worn, they tug at the wearer's arms and help guide
them as they cast magical spells. Every inch of the robe is embroidered with
threads of gold and nocturnium and though they look as if they weigh a ton,
they feel effortlessly light.
   After Knezz ascended as Grand High Sorcerer, he grew tired of relying on
page boys to help him don his heavy robes. What began as a lazy enchantment to
stand the robes on their own soon became a complex animus spell. Perhaps
growing tired of casting his own spells, Knezz eventually enchanted the long
sleeves of the robe to move his arms for him.

However, its goblincraft construction is sturdy and the smell is fairly

   The goblins once traded for weapons and armor, but as their society fell,
they began to imitate the crafts they had once purchased.

without compromising saftey. And despite being made from glass, the shield
takes blow after blow, ringing out like a bell but never shattering.
   Glass armaments were the clear choice under Grand High Sorcerer Kofi, but
since have become rather rare. The shield more closely resembles the tower as
it looked during Kofi's tenure.

it, and you can hear the bone-chilling screams of the damned in the crackles

   The Tower Skycleave has a collection of ice and pykrete weapons from the
Permafrost Wars, though most melted before High Sorcerer Chun devised a spell
that could preserve them on our plane.

   This arcane tome is bound in a solid ebony cover, its pages sewn in by
blood-red thread so fine you cannot identify it. Most of the heavy grimoire's
pages are covered edge-to-edge in different scripts and handwritings, perhaps
translating each page from language to language. Of these, you can read less
than half. But the grimoire's power can still be channeled, if you have the
will.
   Barrosh inherited the grimoire, less its current cover, from his uncle,
Barrad. Sorcery came rarely to their line, and it was necessary from the first
generations to commit spells to text to ensure the family's fortune was not
lost.

Knezz's prismatic focus is lying here.~
   This odd little gem seems to be made from glass or crystal, suspended from a
little leather loop so it can be held safely in one's hand. As light hits the
prism, it splits into beams of every color, from the richest red to the
vibrantest violet. The beams arc around the room, sometimes glancing off a
shiny surface, before focusing back together into brilliant white light that
moves from target to target.
   High Sorcerer Knezz famously used this focus to trace the glimmering light
of a magical beacon to a new source of magewood, helping secure his legacy and
elevating him to the tower's top rank.

A freneticist's starmetal shield is lying here.~
   This magnificent shield is forged from a star that fell from the heavens.
From the imprints, you can see that it was cold-worked in the ancient style,
not forged with fire and smoke. The shield is in the shape of a twinkling star,
though its rough finish hardly scatters light.
   On any clear night, shooting stars can be seen across the land. Despite
this, it is exceedingly rare to find the place where one has fallen, making
starmetal one of the most sought-after minerals.

A stabilized mana shield is lying here.~
   The shield is made only of shimmering light, of the same type that surrounds
sorcerers when they cast a manashield. This one has been shaped into a more
traditional buckler, and someone has managed to stabilize it so that it doesn't
dissipate. A careful glance through the ethereal shield reveals that it also
seems to focus magical attacks cast through it.
   The Tower Skycleave is home to so many rare and precious items that it is
under the near-constant threat of invasion, burglary, and assault. Stabilized
mana shields are de rigueur for the vanguard, which is often full of less-
experienced students incapable of conjuring a shield of their own.

the nocturnium sculpture~
A nocturnium sculpture of a strange creature stands on the dais.~
   The large sculpture in the center of the room looks like it's made of raw,
unrefined nocturnium ore, with chunks of black rock sticking out. In form, it
resembles a hunched person, though it has six arms and indistinct legs. The
lowest pair of arms are thick and rocky, almost resembling muscles, while the
upper four arms are slender and formed from long, twisting cables of wrought
nocturnium.
   If the sculpture was made to resemble a man or woman, you're not sure which.
Its face bears a mouth but no eyes, nose, or ears, though it has been sculpted
to have a thick brow ridge above where the eyes would be.
   The sculpture is warded by a shimmering wall of light that surrounds the
dais and prevents you from getting too close.

an overturned table~
A heavy table has been turned on its side as a barricade.~
   The edges of the table are splintered at the bottom where it was flipped
unceremoniously onto its side and one of the legs is cracked. Still, this
hefty mahogany table provides a safe spot to fling spells -- or arrows -- at
any threat.

A barricade has caught fire!~
   It looks like someone tried unsuccessfully to barricade the area; whether
against intruders or rescuers, you cannot tell. The makeshift barricade has
collapsed as it burns. Luckily, it doesn't seem to catch any of the tower's
rare and expensive ebony paneling on fire.

repository rough-worked worked pedestal scaldorran's scaldorrans lich~
Scaldorran's repository~
A rough-worked stone repository is resting on a pedestal.~
   The repository is an old stone oil lamp. Parts of it are so worn as to give
the impression that it has been around since before brass lamps were first
forged. Every inch of the lamp is cold to the touch, yet water never forms on
its sides. In the dark, it almost seems to glow, but in bright sunlight it
takes on a dark, sinister character.
   A lich is made of pure magic, of a sort that would quickly dissipate after
the death of a sorcerer. But when a sorcerer commands vast power and abundant
cleverness, it is possible to prepare a repository to anchor their magic to the
mortal plane after their body has rotted and their soul has moved on.

standing on legs. The tower and legs are both made of stone, though the tower
is a bit crooked and doesn't form a perfect cylinder. In all regards except for
the legs, it resembles a little sorcery tower.

   These impossibly light, unimaginably thin greaves are molded in the shape of
your shins. The magitanium twists and swirls with iridescent rainbows any time
it can catch even the tiniest glint of light. These greaves are truly a
warrior's dream.
   For a brief time, dubbed "magitanium mania" by High Sorcerer Barrosh, every
pen, clasp, button, and plate in Skycleave was made from magitanium. Still,
among the innovations credited to the Tower, magitanium is most valued by
smiths across the land.

A pair of shadowhide skycleaver trousers is here.~
   In dim light, you can hardly see these mastercrafted trousers. On close
inspection, they are made of fine leather that is so dark, you can scarcely see
it. The outside surface is micro-textured with barbules that produce no sound
when rubbed together, while the inside is lined with the finest cloth.
   As a naturally independent but shy child, Niamh was often accused of
hiding from others. Though it was her brother who dubbed her "Niamh the Shadow
Hide", she reclaimed the title for herself at Skycleave.

A pair of thundersilk skycleaver leggings is lying here.~
   These loose-fitting leggings are made from rare, elegant thundersilk -- a
material that channels every stray spark of static electricity in the air
straight into a sorcerer's body to strengthen their offensive magic.
   Thundersilk was once made by pixies, masters of silk, from the coccoons of
moths that pupated at the lightning-kissed tops of the pixy trees. No pixy
cities yet remain that produce it.

   This midnight-black skirt is made from exceedingly rare soulcoth. When the
pleats of the skirt are opened, the frantic howls of lost souls slip through
from the infinitely dark, unseeable void that lies at the heart of the fabric.
   Soulcloth is meticulously weaved on a splintering loom, usually by a crone.
When the cloth is done, it is boiled along with the weaver in a stone cauldron,
trapping the weaver's soul within. This is considered the greatest honor.

moxteel skycleaver shinguards~
A pair of moxteel skycleaver shinguards are here.~
   The sparkling white shinguards are well-molded to fit the fronts of your
legs. They're small, thin, and shockingly light. This is moxteel, a
magic-infused metal that weighs less than any normal metal while deflecting
blows even when they should be strong enough to pierce it.
   Moxteel was a late invention of Skycleave, after the fad for enchanted glass
armor had started to wane. Though the name is commonly constructed as mocking
steel-wearers, it was, in truth, invented by a sorcerer who fancied herself
The Moxie Witch.

plates tied together by reinforced leather. The magitanium twirls and spins
with iridescent rainbows when light flickers off of it -- truly a warrior's

   Magitanium is an enchanted metal, usually thought to be an infused form of
imperium, though in reality it has been created from many light metals by the
artificers of Skycleave.

A shadowhide skycleaver strap is hanging here.~
   This infinitely black waist strap is made to protect the midsection of a
thief or assassin while still allowing them the full range of movement. The
shadowhide leather is so dark that it's hard to make out details, but on close
inspection you can see that the surface is covered in tiny barbules that reduce
the sound it makes as it rubs against other pieces of armor and clothing.
   The first shadowhide was made by casting a spell on a pair of melanistic
foxes, shrinking and silencing their plush fur. Soon, Niamh devised a better
technique that worked on common leather and required no wild animal.

pop as you run your fingers over it, leaving red marks on your fingers in the
shape of tiny lightning bolts. Wearing the cincture, you can feel all that
energy channeled into your body -- and your magic.
   The fantastically rare nature of thundersilk owes to the way it is normally
created in small squares that must be stitched together, a trait common to all
pixy fabrics.

impossible to see through it or into the folds. When you try to look, gently
pulling open one of the sash's folds, a hollow and haunting scream escapes from
within and freezes both your fingers and your soul.
   Some mageweavers spend their entire careers dreaming of the day they will
make a single bolt of soulcloth, such is the promise of immortality it brings.

a moxteel skycleaver belt~
A moxteel skycleaver belt is lying here.~
   This plated belt is made from sparkling white moxteel, a magic-infused metal
that can only be worked by a skilled wizard. The moxteel is all but unbendable
-- it would sooner leave an impression in your skin than take an impression of
your enemy's weapon itself. Still, it would be hard for anyone to land a blow
through a belt as well-made as this.
   At its inception, moxteel was envisioned as a seat for gems and jewels. That
is, a material suited to crowns and scepters. When it never achieved the
glister of gold, Skycleave turned to its more practical property and began
working armor from it.

wristguard guard magitanium skycleaver~
a magitanium skycleaver wristguard~
A magitanium skycleaver wristguard has been left on the ground.~
   This bulky wristguard looks heavy, but it's surprisingly light -- both
because it's made from magitanium and because of the honeycomb structure
inside, where the magitanium has been shaped to disperse even the most powerful
impacts. As you run your fingers over the wristguard, the iridescent swirls of
the magitanium seem to follow every movement.
   Magitanium originated in a rivalry between High Sorcerer Itania the Moxie
Witch and though she didn't invent it, Itania is credited both with introducing
the metal to Skycleave's artisan sorcerers, and with naming it.

   These wristcuffs are made of shadowhide, a material so dark that it
disappears in dim lighting. As you run your fingers over them, you discover
micro-textured barbules that somehow silence the shadowhide when it brushes up
against other fabrics.
   Having already taken command of the swirling darkness before she came to
Skycleave, the Shadow Hide immediately began infusing it into every jewel,
trinket, device, and creature, and she found a different result with each.

it to pull electricity from the air and channel it into your spells. The
thundersilk is stark white, save for a fair golden sheen that flickers off of
it when it catches the light. You're not sure you've ever seen silk this fine
before.
   The thundersilk moth was once widely herded by pixies in their great tree
cities. There existed a particular technique for unraveling the coccoon while
the pupa slept soundly, able to emerge without cutting the precious silk.

blacker than midnight and rarer than the darkest eclipse. When you tug at the
bracelet and its braids strain against each other, the soulcloth's depths
release an ear-piercing screech that leaves you momentarily stunned.
   Legend holds that a soulcloth weaver can only die if the cloth itself is
placed into an ever-burning fire, of which few are known, and the sheer value
of soulcloth is such that this has never been tested.

iridescent rainbows at the merest touch. Though they're small, the earrings
have been enchanted by a powerful artificer to keep you alive even in the
direst circumstances.
   High Sorcerer Itania, in her travels, traded for many of the artifacts and
relics that line Skycleave's shelves. But her true genius was trading for the
secrets to make them as well, and the process for crafting magitanium was her
crowning achievement.

powerful wizard to help the bearer of these earrings move faster and more
quietly in battle.
   The Shadow Hide became acquainted with darkness at an early age, learning to
twirl it like ribbons and sculpt it like clay. The two were fast friends, and
each shaped the other.

A pair of thundersilk skycleaver earrings are floating in the air.~
   This pair of earrings is made from braided thundersilk threaded through
nocturnium loops. The thundersilk must have been enchanted to be quieter:
although you can still see sparks of lightning climbing up and down the
earrings, it doesn't make that characteristic crackle as it does.
   Thundersilk moths are born from eggs laid under the highest leaves of great
trees, where lightning is at its closest. Their caterpillars have furry backs
that crisp and sizzle as stray sparks in the air are caught and channeled.

fortunately, it doesn't let out the ear-piercing wails like ordinary soulcloth
does when you disturb it.
   Bolts of soulcloth can be as many yards long as the weaver lived, so a
single bolt of the stuff is often split into many smaller pieces, at the cost
of fragmenting the soul held within.

magical metal so light you can barely feel them. The earrings have a red glint
to them not native to the moxteel, suggesting they might carry a powerful

   The process for creating moxteel is tightly guarded by the Tower Skycleave
even after the Moxie Witch was twice abducted by envious ironmongers who forced
the secret out of her. Both abductors vanished within a fortnight of her
release.

from the smallest feathers to the noble grimace on its beak. This is the world-
renowned Golden Peacock, prized heirloom of Trense, envy of the seven baronies.
   The first lords of Trense wore such bright and ostentatious silks that their
peers accused them of peacocking. When Stane of Skour presented a stuffed
peacock to Marquel of Trense and Lady Gorgea as a wedding gift, it was meant as
a slight. But Lord Marquel had the bird replicated in gold and placed above the
mantle.

the swirling vortex~
A swirling vortex atop the tower keeps you from climbing the stairs.~
   The vortex whips and roars on the tower above you with winds so strong you
can't even climb the stairs. It sounds like somebody is locked in mortal combat
above you and you won't be able to climb the stairs until someone has died.

heartwood wood time pillar great~
the heartwood of time~
A great pillar of heartwood stands atop the tower.~
   The dark red wood, scultped with a heart and arteries, stands in a tall
column atop the tower. The heart has a slow, steady double-beat with glints of
red and blue light traveling from the heart to the top of the column and then
back down again.
   Time itself is being drawn up into the heartwood, then echoed back on itself
in an endless cycle. Surely this is what is responsible for the sorry state of
the Tower Skycleave. Your only hope now is to burn the heartwood in hopes of
ending the cycle and rescuing the sorcerers from this odious time loop.

A hand-written note is lying here.~
You read the writing on the piece of parchment:

             Amor,

                Though it was but a few fleeting moments, the
             evening we spent together meant the world to me.
             Your eyes captivate me like the chandelier; your
             mind is as deep as the Milky Way, and twice as
             enchanting.
                I can't get our encounter out of my head. Meet
             me again. Soon.

                                              xo D.

             P.S. -- Do NOT tell Marina.

A glittering red potion is sitting on the ground.~
   The red potion swirls as you hold it up to the light, glittering with swirls
of yellow like pixy dust in caught in a whirlpool. There's no label on the
flask and no way to tell what effect it will have but to quaff it.

A filigreed stasis charm is lying on the ground.~
   The charm is made entirely from nocturnium filigree, expertly crafted to
look like knitted metal. At the center of the charm, the negative space between
the filigree forms the outline of a person. The whole thing dangles from a
thin gold chain, tarnished at the back from heavy wear.

an obsidian stabber~
An obsidian stabber has been dropped here.~
   The little obsidian shiv is surprisingly well-shaped. The blade is almost
wafer-thin, with tiny serrations along both sides. A simple strap of leather
around the base serves as a simple handle. It may be small, but this thing is
thin enough to slide between ribs and long enough to pierce the heart.

A little gemstone flute has been left here.~
   The flute is carved from a single piece of iridescent gemstone which
glitters in every color of the rainbow as the light strikes it. Nineteen tiny
holes run the length of the flute. It's difficult to play, but the music is
transcendental.
   Hold the flute to play it.

A gemstone knife is stabbed into the ground.~
   The blade of the short, thin knife is near-transparent sapphire with an edge
that could split the hair on a moth. At its base, it swirls into a jade handle
with no seam or joint; the two minerals seem to flow into each other. At the
base of the handle, the knife is finished with opal that equally has no
boundary.

   A soft azure light casts out from the oversized tree bud. Though its petals
are unimaginably thin, they are as hard as sapphire. But as you watch the bud
glow, you find that its edges are slowly turning to ash; its brilliance is as
ephemeral as the setting sun.

   A bolt of lightning flickers back and forth inside the tightly-corked flask.
At times, it's so bright it becomes difficult to look at. The flask is packaged
like a potion, but there's no way to tell what effect it will have except to
quaff it.
   The pages of Skycleave are notoriously quick on their feet, in no small part
due to heavy dependence on potions. It never pays to fall behind in the black
tower.

a gnarled old wand~
A gnarled old wand lies on the ground.~
   If not for the raw power flowing off of the old wand, it might look like a
fallen twig. It is perhaps a foot and a half long, lightly discolored around
the base, and otherwise the only notable feature is the initials carved into
the end.
   Sophisticated magic users fall broadly into two categories: those who prefer
staves and those who prefer wands. While a staff is larger and therefore easier
to channel mana through, a wand is more easily concealed and capable of a much
finer focus.

shape, but none of them is very deep. The pools closer to the stairs are
well-lit, while the ones in the back of the grotto are difficult to see.

A glass sculpture of YOU stands in the middle of the viney maze.~
   You walk all the way around the sculpture, stunned by its nose, its hair,
it eyes. In every way, it looks like you -- every bone, every curve, every
scar and mole. Everything except the clothing. Some great master has sculpted
you in the classical style, perhaps a little too realistically, but this is
nevertheless a great work of art.
   Destroying the sculpture is the furthest thing from your mind. Or, it was,
until just now.
   Vanity and narcissism are common pitfalls of great sorcerers.

You can't quite press your hand against it, so it isn't solid, but nor can you

A crooked grin breaks on her face as she laughs -- cackles, even -- at your
attempt to pass her impenetrable shield.

A trickle of putrid sap flows from the rotting tree.~
   The sap swirls in shades of amber and green as it bleeds from rotten core of

almost unconsciously, and it starts to creep up your fingers. You recoil,
equally unconsciously, but as you wipe it off your fingers, you feel a
revolting urge to taste it.
   To the people of Smol Nes-Pik, wasting the tree's sap is a great crime, as
every last pint of it is precious.
