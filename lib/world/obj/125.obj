tiny fingers, so it was surely made by goblins. However, the magic words of the
chants are written in the common human tongue. Perhaps goblins think human
languages are magical? Four chants are still legible in the old book:
 - Binding: A spell to make roots entangle something.
 - Rust: A spell to bring down salty water to destroy machines.
 - Lightning: A spell to call down a lightning strike.
 - Rats: A spell to summon friendly rats.
