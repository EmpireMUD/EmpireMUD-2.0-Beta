tavern tipsy tortoise building inn~
the Tipsy Tortoise Tavern~
The Tipsy Tortoise Tavern stands precariously on the creature's back.~
   The tavern is a tall building and looks quite old. Large sections of the
walls have been repaired in different types of wood, likely sourced wherever
the tortoise happens to have roamed. The building is held to the massive
creature by a great leather strap, made from an animal so massive that the
strap reaches unbroken around the tortoise's shell. The tavern is loud enough
that you can nearly make out their song from here.

as you can tell, suggests two ingots of copper or tin, 5 handfulls of bile-
berries crushed into paste, and some fiber to stablize it. And, as the

the plains or desert and perhaps with some care, you can get it to hatch.
Raising an atlasian tortoise is notoriously difficult, though, and you recall
reading somewhere in the guildhall that caring for an atlasian egg requires
many rare materials such as magewood, wild fire, violet gems, molten essence,
skystones, and burning salve.
