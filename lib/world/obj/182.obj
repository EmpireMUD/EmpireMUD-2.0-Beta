tavern tipsy tortoise building inn~
the Tipsy Tortoise Tavern~
The Tipsy Tortoise Tavern stands precariously on the creature's back.~
   The tavern is a tall building and looks quite old. Large sections of the
walls have been repaired in different types of wood, likely sourced wherever
the tortoise happens to have roamed. The building is held to the massive
creature by a great leather strap, made from an animal so massive that the
strap reaches unbroken around the tortoise's shell. The tavern is loud enough
that you can nearly make out their song from here.

the tavern door~
The tavern door swings freely as the tortoise shakes.~
   The door swings back and forth as the tortoise sways, blocking little from
the outside. Its hinges are sturdy, perhaps imperium, although they don't match
the rest of the hardware of the rest of the building, so they must have been
replacements.

A fountain of pitch-black water hovers in the air.~
   The fountain appears black as midnight, but has the soft babble and cool
touch of water. It spins and cycles in the air, free of any container, as if
gravity hasn't noticed it in this dark corner.

A boundless cornucopia of food sits on the counter.~
   The cornucopia sits on the counter, overflowing with breads, fruits, meats,
and all manner of other foods. Each time you take a piece, a little more food
falls out of the cornucopia. But if you move too far from it, the food crumbles
and is gone.

An atlasian egg is here.~
   This massive, leathery egg could only have come from an atlasian tortoise.
It's so large that you can feel its heartbeat through shell. 'Plant' the egg in
the plains or desert and perhaps with some care, you can get it to hatch.
Raising an atlasian tortoise is notoriously difficult, though, and you recall
reading somewhere in the guildhall that caring for an atlasian egg requires
many rare materials such as magewood, wild fire, violet gems, molten essence,
skystones, and burning salve.

more. The ring has a surprisingly warm feeling to it, as if it has been
enchanted, though you sense no enchantment. The top of the ring is emblazoned
with the crest of the Guild of Adventurers.

through the warm enchantment that pervades the ring, and sense that its true
material is simple hay. But the enchantment is powerful and you can see nothing
but the scales on the ring, each with the tiny stamp of the seal of the Guild
of Adventurers.
