Welcome to EmpireMUD. You start the game at a Tower of Souls, in a friendly
and hospitable part of the world. You can use TRANSPORT to get to other Towers
of Souls from there. If you've played other types of CircleMUDs before, some
of the commands will be familiar to you already. But you've already noticed the
biggest difference: You see a map of the region around you instead of a room
description.

If you're using the ASCII map, each map tile is 4 letters wide and uses icons
like &c~~~~&0 for river and &g^^^^&0 for forest. You can see more symbols on
the help files for LEGEND and CROPS.

You can type SCORE to see a sheet of information about your character, with
your name, play time, and skills. It also shows your health, moves, and mana in
the form of &gcurrent&0/&gmax&0/+&gregen&0/5s (amount per 5 seconds). You can
also get this information in your PROMPT or over MDSP.

Here are some starting commands you will want to know from the get go:
   EQUIPMENT (eq)   INVENTORY (i)   SKILLS         QUEST (q)
   SEW              CRAFT           TOGGLE         EMPIRE
   DIG              CHOP            SKIN           GET
   SCRAPE           HARVEST         PICK           WHO
   BUILD            /NEWBIE         TELL           WEAR

You can find tutorials around the starting area that will teach you to gather
resources, build a house, and craft clothing. You may also find areas such as
the Goblin Mines, where you can learn how to go on adventures.

Your empire has goals that you can complete to unlock more buildings, larger
cities, and other perks. Use the PROGRESS command to see your current goals.

Before it gets dark, you should learn to make a torch. GATHER some sticks in
the forest. CRAFT 'fire sticks' from two of the sticks and then LIGHT a third
stick to make a torch.

You begin the game with some bread to EAT and water to DRINK. If you see a
river or an oasis, you can FILL your bottle with water again. You can FORAGE
for fruits and nuts for simple foods in the wild, but they aren't very filling.
Or, you can learn the Survival skill and BUTCHER animals to COOK food. But
don't worry, you won't starve to death -- you'll just find that you take longer
to perform some tasks and you regain health and moves more slowly (you can
always SLEEP to regenerate faster).

If you find it difficult to navigate the map, you may want to buy the
NAVIGATION ability, from the Survival skill. It will give you coordinates for
each location. When you buy this ability, your map may rotate. That means your
character didn't know which way was actually North until now.
