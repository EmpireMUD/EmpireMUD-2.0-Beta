Welcome to EmpireMUD. You start the game at a Tower of Souls, in a friendly
and hospitable part of the world. You can use TRANSPORT to get to other Towers
of Souls from there. If you've played other types of CircleMUDs before, some
of the commands will be familiar to you already. But you've already noticed the
biggest difference: You see a map of the region around you instead of a room
description.

If you're using the ASCII map, each map tile is 4 letters wide and uses icons
like &c~~~~&0 for river and &g^^^^&0 for forest. You can see more symbols on
the help files for MAP and CROPS.

You can type SCORE to see a sheet of information about your character, with
your name, play time, and skills. It also shows your health, moves, and mana in
the form of &gcurrent&0/&gmax&0/+&gregen&0/5s (amount per 5 seconds). You can
also see get this information in your PROMPT or over MDSP.

Here are some starting commands you will want to know from the get go:
   EQUIPMENT (eq)   INVENTORY (i)   SKILLS         QUEST (q)
   SEW              CRAFT           TOGGLE         EMPIRE
   DIG              CHOP            SKIN           GET
   SCRAPE           HARVEST         PICK           WHO
   BUILD            /NEWBIE         TELL           WEAR

You can find tutorials around the starting area that will teach you to gather
resources, build a house, and craft clothing. You may also find areas such as
the Goblin Mines, where you can learn how to go on adventures.

Before it gets dark, you should learn to make a torch. GATHER a stick in the
forest, and DIG up a flint and a rock. CRAFT a 'flint set' from the rocks, and
then LIGHT the stick to make a torch.

You begin the game with some bread to EAT and water to DRINK. If you see a
river or an oasis, you can FILL your bottle with water again. You can PICK
fruit from orchards and you can HARVEST other crops. Or, you can learn the
Survival skill and BUTCHER animals to COOK food. But don't worry, you won't
starve to death -- you'll just find that you take longer to perform some tasks
and you regain health and moves more slowly (you can always SLEEP to regenerate
faster).

If you find it difficult to navigate the map, you may want to buy the
Navigation ability, from the Survival skill. It will give you coordinates for
each location. When you buy this ability, your map may rotate. That means your
character didn't know which way was actually North until now.
