.TT.  Guard Tower  (Raise Armies ability)
'TT'  Advanced Tower  (Advanced Tactics ability)
"TT"  Superior Tower  (Advanced Tactics ability)

Built on:  plains, desert

Guard towers are defensive structures that automatically shoot at foes within
range. These are often an empire's first line of defense against intruders. A
fort or great house is equivalent in range and ability to a superior tower.

Guard towers may only be built inside cities.

If your empire's disposition is set to "Friendly", towers will only shoot at
people you distrust or are at war with. If your disposition is "Distrustful",
they will shoot at anyone you're not at peace (or better) with.

Guard towers periodically shoot at any hostile player, as well as any animal
that is leading a catapult. Advanced and Superior towers do increasingly larger
amounts of damage. Forts do the same amount of damage as a regular guard tower.

Regular guard towers have a range of 2 tiles. All other guard towers and forts
have a range of 3 tiles. In the case of forts, this distance is measured from
the entrance.

Towers can fire over walls and buildings, but won't fire into mountains at all,
and won't shoot into overgrown forests (&g^^^^&0) unless it is into tile
adjacent to the tower. Plan the area around your towers carefully.

Some abilities allow players to avoid detection by guard towers.

Guard towers do not block players from circling around them. For optimum
protection, build lines of wall-tower-wall-tower-wall. The walls block the
circle command.
