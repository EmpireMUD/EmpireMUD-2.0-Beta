they will shoot at anyone you're not at peace (or better) with.

Guard towers periodically shoot at any hostile player, as well as hostile
vehicles. Advanced and Superior towers do increasingly larger amounts of
damage.

Regular guard towers have a range of 2 tiles. All other guard towers have a
range of 3 tiles. Towers can fire over walls and buildings, but won't fire
into mountains. Some abilities allow players to avoid detection.
