Guard towers periodically shoot at any hostile player, as well as any animal
that is leading a catapult. Advanced and Superior towers do increasingly larger
amounts of damage.

Regular guard towers have a range of 2 tiles. All other guard towers have a
range of 3 tiles. Towers can fire over walls and buildings, but won't fire
into mountains. Some abilities allow players to avoid detection.

If you die, you will find yourself resurrected at your own tomb, so long as
it's nearby. Otherwise, you'll find yourself at a random tomb or cemetery
on the continent where you died, or at a starting location if there isn't a
tomb available.
