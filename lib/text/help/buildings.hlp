Build (Trade ability)

Usage:  build <building> [direction]

This command is used to create buildings using raw materials. Most buildings
require a direction that they'll face. Resources are added from left to right

typing 'build info <building>'. Typing 'build' by itself will resume work if
you're in an incomplete building, or will list what you can build if not.

with that empire.

Until a building is completed, you can walk into and out of it freely, and you
can't build any additional rooms inside. Once finished, nobody who is not
loyal to your empire will be able to enter.

Guard towers may only be built inside cities.

If your empire's disposition is set to "Friendly", towers will only shoot at
people you distrust or are at war with. If your disposition is "Distrustful",
they will shoot at anyone you're not at peace (or better) with.

Guard towers periodically shoot at any hostile player, as well as hostile
vehicles. Advanced and Superior towers do increasingly larger amounts of
damage.

Regular guard towers have a range of 2 tiles. All other guard towers have a
range of 3 tiles. Towers can fire over walls and buildings, but won't fire
into mountains. Some abilities allow players to avoid detection.
