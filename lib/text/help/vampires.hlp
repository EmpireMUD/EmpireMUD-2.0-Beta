VAMPIRE VAMPIRES "VAMPIRE SKILL"

Vampire (skill)

The Vampire skill tree contains all the powers of these creatures of the night.
Vampirism is not a curse, per se, but its powers do come at a price: vampires
must drink blood. Vampires are not harmed by the sun, but their powers do not
function in broad daylight.

Vampires at skill level 15 or bellow are constantly hungry, losing a blood
point ever hour even if they have no blood powers active. At such low levels,
these vampires gain skill just by drinking the blood of others. Higher level
vampires have an hourly upkeep based only on which powers are active. See the
help file on BITE for more information on drinking blood.

To become a vampire, seek out another of their kind -- if you dare.

Check out &yHELP VAMPIRE GUIDE&0 for a getting-started.

#
BITE

Usage:  bite <target> 

A vampire is only as good as the blood it drinks. Use this command to bite a
victim and drink their blood. This means that you will suck the blood from
your victim until they have no blood remaining. This is vital to replenish
your blood points. This WILL kill your victim, so use it cautiously. Of course,
you could always stop before your victim dies.

You can use "toggle bother" to turn on and off no-bother. If you are no-bother,
vampires cannot bite you without permissions.

To bite an NPC or a player who hasn't toggled "bother", you must first knock
them out in combat. You can "toggle autokill" to stop yourself from killing
them instead, and then bite them when they are knocked out or very injured.

Example:
  > bite wolf

it regenerates 15. And higher than that, it regenerates 25.
