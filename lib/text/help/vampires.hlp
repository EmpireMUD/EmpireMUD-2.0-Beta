VAMPIRE VAMPIRES "VAMPIRE SKILL" VAM VAMP

Vampire (skill)

The Vampire skill tree contains all the powers of these creatures of the night.
Vampirism is not a curse, per se, but its powers do come at a price: vampires
must drink blood. Vampires are not harmed by the sun, but their powers do not
function in broad daylight.

Vampires at low skill levels are constantly hungry, losing a blood point every
hour even if they have no blood powers active. At such low levels, the easiest
way to gain Vampire skill is to use the Bite ability to drink the blood of
others. Higher level vampires have an hourly upkeep based only on which powers
are active. See the help file on BITE for more information on drinking blood.

To become a vampire, seek out another of their kind -- if you dare. If you no
longer want to be a vampire, find a player who can Purify you.

Check out &yHELP VAMPIRE GUIDE&0 for a getting-started.

You can get additional Vampire abilities when you reach level 100, depending on
which other skills you have at high levels. Use the 'role' command to choose
which set of skills to use.

#
BITE

Bite (Vampire ability)

Usage:  bite [target]
Cooldown:  12 seconds

A vampire is only as good as the blood it drinks. Use this command to bite a
victim and drink their blood. This means that you will suck the blood from
your victim until they have no blood remaining. This is vital to replenish
your blood points. This WILL kill your victim, so use it cautiously. Of course,
you could always stop before your victim dies.

You can also bite as a melee attack in combat. This deals damage based on your
Strength, but briefly reduces your Dodge by 100%. It also has a 33% chance
to cause the target to change its focus to you, if it was attacking someone
else. The Savage Bite ability changes some of these behaviors.

You can use "toggle bother" to turn on and off no-bother. If you are no-bother,
vampires cannot bite you unless you are in a situation where they could attack
you.

Non-vampires can use this command, too, but will only pretend to bite.

Example:
  > bite wolf
