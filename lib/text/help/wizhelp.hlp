ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <access level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new access level. If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
godlist will automatically be recreated.

Don't confuse access levels with skill/gear levels.

Example:
  > advance rasmussen 4

#d
APPROVE

Usage: approve <name> <e-mail>

This command approves a character so that he/she can use empire and ubilding
commands. You must supply an e-mail address so that players can be verified
as unique.

The reasons for only having 1 approved mortal are:
 - You could build 10x faster with 10 approved mortals
 - Your resources would be exponential with 5 guys chopping trees at once
 - Your empire could claim the entire world if it had those extra members

Keep it fair.
#d
AT WIZAT

Usage: at <room | coords | item | mob | player name> <command> <arguments>

AT can be used to perform an action in a location other than where you are
standing. The first argument can be a virtual room number or the name of a
character or object. The remainder of the line is passed to the command
interpreter.

Examples:

  > at 3001 look
  > at dog kill dog
  > at 3.corpse get all corpse
  > at catje wave catje
  > at (0,0) bark  -- There must be no spaces in the coordinates

See also: GOTO
#d
AUTHORIZE

Usage:  authorize <name>

This command is used if the mud requires character authorization. Authorization
is configured via the "config game" command. If it's shut off, players will
automatically authorize during character creation.

If you wish to use authorization on your EmpireMUD, you should turn on the
'require_auth' game config and then either use the 'authorize' command
manually, or set up an automatic system.
#d
AUTOWIZ

Usage:  autowiz

Regenerates the wizlist.
#d
BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the site
substring from logging in to the game. You may ban a site to ALL, NEW or
SELECT players. Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players from
registering. Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections from
that site. Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok flags
to log in from that site. Ban with no argument returns a list of currently
banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

See also: WIZLOCK
#d
CLEARABILITIES

Usage: clearabilities <player> <skill | all>

This command resets the abilities for the target player. They keep their skill
percentages, but may re-purchase all their abilities. You can either target a
specific skill, or "all".

See also: SET
#d
CONFIG

Usage:  config <set> [-v]
        config <set> <key> [value]

This privileged command controls many global game configurations. You can get
view explanations for the configs using the -v option with any set of configs.
Be careful changing global configs, as some of them make powerful changes to
features.

There is no undo button, but all changes are logged.

If you want to experiment with the system, you can change test_config in the
"other" set.
#b
CREATE

Usage:  create [number] <item>

This command allows a God or Immortal to create one or more simple items
instantly. Normally, only resources and simple tools can be created this way.
In order to create items, you must have the correct resources available. You
get resources when people sacrifice items to you. Resource counts can be seen
on your score sheet.

See also: SACRIFICE, SCORE
#e
DATE

Shows the current real time. (Not a social)
#d
DC

Usage: dc <descriptor number>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket. If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who are stuck in character creation.

See also: USERS
#d
DISTANCE

Usage:  distance <location>

This computes the map distance between your current location and any target.
You can target players, coordinates, or anything else you could target with
commands like 'goto'.

The mortal version of this is 'mark'.

See also: MARK
#d
ECHO GECHO SEND

Usage: echo <message>
       gecho <message>
       send <victim> <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.
GECHO displays the string to everyone in the game.
SEND displays the string to a particular person.

Regular ECHO supports @target and #item just like emote.

Examples:

  > echo Hi, everyone in the room.
  > gecho Hi, everyone in the game, isn't this annoying?
  > send rasmussen You are being watched.

See also: EMOTE
#d
EDELETE

Usage: edelete <empire>

Immortal tool to delete an empire.
#d
EDITNOTES NOTES "PLAYER NOTES" "ADMIN NOTES" "EDIT NOTES"

Usage:  editnotes <player>
        show notes <player>

You can edit and leave notes about a player, to help inform other immortals
of disciplinary issues or unusual authorizations. Any immortal can see the
notes on any player below his own level, and can only set notes on players
below his own level.
#d
FILE

Usage: file <file> <lines>

Displays the last X lines of a file in the shell. This is useful for seeing 
recent bad password attempts, ideas, and other information. Unfortunately, 
these files are not refreshed unless the mud actually shuts down (not using the 
reboot feature). For this reason, the mud should probably be rebooted 
from time to time so that the autorun script parses the syslog into the 
smaller logs.
#d
FORCE

Usage: force <victim | all | room> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action. FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Only the Implementor level can force all/room.

Example:
  > force dog drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look dog

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
#d
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented on CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent a
player from playing. If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered by
the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: SET -> FROZEN
#d
FULLSAVE

Usage: fullsave

This allows you to force all of the zones in the world to save. They will
only do so if they've been flagged for saves (thus minimizing lag).
#d
GHISTORY "GODHISTORY" "WIZNET HISTORY" WIZHISTORY

Usage:  ghistory

This is the history command for the immortal and god channels.

See also: WIZNET
#d
GODNET /

The gods' communication channel.

Usage:  godnet [#level] <test>

See also: GHISTORY
#e
GOTO TRANSFER

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim> [location]

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room you're in, or another location.

For both GOTO and TRANS, the location specifier can be either a virtual room
number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans dog
  > trans dog 3001
  > trans dog 2.dog

See also: POOFIN, POOFOUT, WIZAT
#d
GRANTS

Grants allow a player to use commands that are above his or her privilege
level. Grants can be added or removed using the "set" command. Mortals can also
be granted access to some immortal commands, but this isn't always a good idea.

Most of the grant names correspond to actual commands, but some are special:
 empires - Allows eedit, edelete, moveeinv, and more.
 olc - Allows .olc, vnum, and vstat.
 olc-controls - Allows .setflags, .setminvnum, and .setmaxvnum.

See also: OLC-CONTROLS 
#d
HANDBOOK

Usage: handbook

Guidelines for having an Immortal character -- you should read it.
#d
HOLYLIGHT

Usage:  toggle holylight

A toggle which allows you to see:
   Invisible people and objects, even if you don't have 'detect invisibility'
   Hidden people, even if you don't have 'sense life'
   Dark rooms, even if you don't have a light

It is expected most immortals will keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time; it
exists so that you have the ability to see what mortals see for debugging
purposes.
#d
IMOTD

Usage: imotd

Displays the Immortal message of the day. This file usually contains new
information on commands recently added, new features and other important
information that immortals should be aware of.

See also: MOTD
#d
INSTANCE INSTANCES

Usage:  instance <list | add | delete | deleteall | nearby | reset | test> [argument]

This command allows immortals to list and manage adventure zone instances.
The 'list' command can be used to see all instances, or all instances for one
adventure zone (vnum). To see only instances near you, use the 'nearby' feature
and, optionally, provide a distance.

The 'delete' command deletes by number in the list.

The 'deleteall' command removes all instances for a given adventure zone
(by vnum).

The 'reset' command will force a zone reset on the instance you're in or the
instance number you target.

The 'test' command will link an instance to the room you're in, using a generic
portal, even if that instance cannot be linked.
#d
INVIS INVISIBLE

Usage: invis [level]

INVIS sets your invisibility level. With no argument, invis toggles between
making you fully visible and fully invisible. If you specify a level, only
people at and above the level you specify will be able to see you.

Examples:

  > invis
  > invis 3

See also: INVSTART, VISIBLE
#d
INVSTART INVISSTART "INVIS START" "INV START" "START INVISIBLE"

Usage:  set <name> invstart <on | off>

This setting causes a player to be invisible on login, instead of keeping his
or her invisibility setting from the last logout.

If you want to log in invisibly in one login only, type "i" at the MOTD when
prompted to press any key to enter the game.

See also: INVIS, VISIBLE
#d
LAST

Usage: last <player_name>

For checking the last time a person logged on, their sitename, and their ID
number.

Example: 

  > last ras
  [  24] [1] Ras          : somesite.edu : Tue May 16 22:07:09 1995

See also: STAT
#d
LOAD

Usage: load <mob | obj> <virtual number>

LOAD is used to create mobiles and objects. The first argument specifies if
you are trying to load a mobile or an object; the second is the virtual
number.

Example:

  > load obj 1
  You create a bulletin board.

  > load mob 1
  You create a snarling wolf.

See also: VNUM
#d
MOVEEINV "MOVE EINV" "MOVE EMPIRE INVENTORY"

Usage: moveeinv "<empire>" <from island> <to island>

This command allows an immortal to move an empire's inventory from one island
to another. All stored items one on island are transferred to the other.

You can use 'show islands <empire>' to see which island ids have items stored.

This command is meant to be used to fix problems for mortals, not to assist
them in moving around the world. It should only be treated as a repair tool.

See also: EINV, SHOW
#d
MUTE

Usage: mute <victim>

MUTE is used to shut a player up. When muted, a player will not be able to
use most communication channels until he/she is unmuted.

See also: FLAGS
#d
NOTITLE

Usage: notitle <vicitim>

Prevent players from being able to set their own titles; i.e., if the player
consistently has an offensive title. The definition of offensive is left as
an exercise for the reader.

See also: TITLE
#d
NOWIZNET "NO WIZNET"

Usage: toggle wiznet

Allows you to hear or ignore messages coming over the wiznet.

See also: WIZNET
#d
PAGE

Usage: page <player | all> <message>

PAGE is used to send a message, along with a beep, to another player. Use
PAGE ALL to send a message and a beep to everyone in the game.

Examples:

  > page rasmussen Hey, are you still at the keyboard?
  > page all GAME WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN IN 10 MINUTES

Do not abuse this command.
#d
POOFIN POOFOUT

Usage: poofin <message | none>
       poofout <message | none>

Sets the message seen by players when you use GOTO to move to a different
room. POOFIN with no argument resets your poofin to the default "appears with
an ear-splitting bang"; POOFOUT with no argument defaults to "disappears in a
puff of smoke."

If you want your name in the middle of the poofin/out message, instead of at
the beginning, you can use the $n token to place it anywhere. If you don't
use the $n token, your name will appear at the beginning.

You can remove your poofin or poofout with the "none" command.

Example:
 > poofin There is a blinding flash of light, and $n appears!
 > goto Foo
 There is a blinding flash of light, and Bob appears!

See also: GOTO
#e
PURGE

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things. If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players. If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed. If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection. For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

See also: DC
#d
RANDOM

Usage: random

This is used to go to a random room on the world map. It's very useful for
finding new places to build an island.
#d
REBOOT

Usage: reboot [now | minutes]

You can use this to either trigger an instant reboot, or count one down. 
Because this is a reboot and saves everything, no information is ever lost.
However, players also enjoy some warning and may appreciate knowing that
you're going to reboot. It may also interrupt their fighting.

To reboot immediately, use the 'now' option. Otherwise, typing it with no
arguments displays the current status.
#d
RELOAD

Usage: reload < '*' | all | file >

Reload is used to reload text files such as the MOTD from disk into memory. 
Reload * reloads all the text files below.

Valid files are:

  credits    (/mud_dir/lib/text/credits)
  intros     (/mud_dir/lib/text/intros/*)
  handbook   (/mud_dir/lib/text/handbook)
  help       (/mud_dir/lib/text/help)
  immlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/immlist)
  imotd      (/mud_dir/lib/text/imotd)
  news       (/mud_dir/lib/text/news)
  motd       (/mud_dir/lib/text/motd)
  info       (/mud_dir/lib/text/info)
  policy     (/mud_dir/lib/text/policies)
  wizlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/wizlist)
  xhelp      (/mud_dir/lib/text/help/*)
#d
RESCALE

Usage:  rescale <mob/item> <level>

This command allows you to rescale a mob of item. It checks for a matching mob
in the room first, then an item in your inventory, then an item on the ground.

The level you choose will still be constrained by the mob/item's minimum and
maximum scale value.

Caution: Rescaling an item will almost always cause it to be re-loaded and it
will lose any enchantments or modifications.
#d
RESTORE

Usage: restore <player | mobile>

RESTORE restores a player or mobile to full hit, mana, and movement points.
It also resets all cooldowns.

If used on immortals, it also sets all skill levels to 100%.
#d
RETURN

Usage: return

RETURN returns you to your regular body if you are switched into a mob.

See also: SWITCH
#d
ROOMFLAGS

Usage:  toggle roomflags

This immortal toggle allows you to see flags and vnums on the "look" command.
#d
SET

Usage: set [file | player] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on. If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost. If you wish to set a
player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the FILE
argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

See also: STAT, STARTING LOCATION
#d
SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [now | timer] [die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down. The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
EmpireMUD's 'autorun' script. If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless. If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

die - Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
   explicitly run again.
pause - Create a file called 'pause' in Empire's root directory; do not
   try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.

You can also set a timer, giving the players some warning before the reboot.

If you type this command with no arguments, it will give the current status.
If you want to shutdown with no timer, use the 'now' option.

See also: REBOOT
#d
SLAY

Usage: slay

This is an instant-kill power for the Implementor which was originally part of
CircleMUD's normal kill command. It has been filtered out because we found it
to be easier to have it separate.
#d
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command;
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.
#d
STAT

Usage: stat [adventure | building | player | object | mobile | room | template | file] [name]

Gives information about players, animals, and objects in the game. The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with
names such as Wolf or Dolph.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for animals.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

Examples:

  > stat dog
  > stat player wolf
  > stat mobile wolf
  > stat file niandra
  > stat object shawl

See also: VSTAT
#d
SWITCH

Usage: switch <monster>

SWITCH is used to take over the body of mobiles; useful for interactive
adventures. If the monster in which you are switched is killed you will be
returned to your own body.

See also: RETURN
#d
SYSLOG

Usage:  syslog [add | remove] [type]
        syslog all

The SYSLOG command controls how detailed of an on-line system log you see.
Messages surrounded by '[' and ']' are syslog messages and are in green
if you have color on. If they are only shown to high-level imms, the level will
be indicated.

See also: TOGGLE
#d
TEDIT

Usage: tedit <message>

Allows you to alter a game message or text file from within the game.
#d
TELEPORT

Usage: teleport <person/location>

This command allows a god to teleport from one location to another. The target
location may be coordinates like (123, 456). It may be a player, or even a
room vnum.

See also: POOFIN, POOFOUT
#e
UNBIND

Usage:  unbind <item>

This immortal command removes the binding on an object that is bind-on-equip
or bind-on-pickup. It will re-bind to the next mortal it's given to.

UPTIME

Usage: uptime

Displays when the game was booted and calculates how long ago that was.
#d
USERS

Usage: users [switches]

USERS gives a list of all sockets (i.e., connections) currently active on the
MUD. The multi-column display shows the socket number (used by DC), class,
level, and name of the player connected, connection state, idle time, and
hostname.

The following switches are available:

-k or -o   Show only outlaws (killers and thieves).
-p         Show only sockets in the playing sockets.
-d         Show only non-playing (deadweight) sockets.
-l min-max Show only sockets whose characters are from level min to max.
-n <name>  Show the socket with <name> associated with it.
-h <host>  Show all sockets from <host>.

See also: DC
#d
UTILITY

Usage:  utility <option> <arguments>

This is a generic command that houses several simple utilities for immortals.
They generally have no game effect, but can help with testing.

Available utilities:
 diminish <number> <scale> - applies the game's diminishing returns formula,
    and returns the result.
 playerdump - Outputs a data file with tab-separated lines for all players with
    account, playtime, and host.
 randtest [number] [size] - generates a large number of random numbers, and
    reports the results.
 redoislands - renumbers all the islands (requires confirmation; may rearrange
    empire inventories).
#d
VNUM

Usage:  vnum <type> <keywords>

Gives a list of the virtual numbers of objects or mobiles which have the
specified name. If you specify more than one keyword, it will find things
that match ALL of those keywords.

Valid types are: adventure, building, craft, crop, obj, mob, 
                 roomtemplate, sector

Examples:

  > vnum obj ring
  1. [  904] a platinum ring
  2. [ 2543] a seashell ring
  3. [ 2588] a small emerald ring
  
  > vnum mob dragon
  1. [    1] Puff

                 roomtemplate, sector

Examples:

  > vstat obj 3000
  > vstat mob 3001

See also: LOAD, STAT, VNUM
#d
WIZHELP

Usage: wizhelp

Gives a list of the special commands available at your level.
#d
WIZLOCK

Usage: wizlock [value] [message]

WIZLOCK allows you to restrict the game. WIZLOCK 1 prevents new characters
