"ACCESS LEVEL"

Access levels determine what commands a player can use. This is mainly used for
immortals. Here is a breakdown of the access levels:

 1 - Mortal: players
 2 - God: an unused system for advanced players
 3 - Immortal: the base admin level
 4 - Assistant
 5 - Co-Implementor: can use virtually all commands and privileges
 6 - Implementor: the top access level

Immortals and Assistants don't have access to most of the admin commands.
Instead, they can be given specific commands with the grant system.

#d
ADVANCE

Usage:  advance <victim> <access level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new access level. If used to promote a player to an
immortal or god level, the wizlist and godlist will automatically be recreated.
This command is grantable.

Don't confuse access levels with skill/gear levels.

Example:
  > advance rasmussen 4

See also: GRANT, SET
#d
APPROVE UNAPPROVE AUTHORIZED AUTHORIZATION APPROVAL

Usage:  approve <name>
        unapprove <name>

If the mud is configured to require approval for players/characters, the
'approve' command gives that approval, and the 'unapprove' command revokes it.
This command is grantable.

The command "config approval -v" will show the current configuration.

See also: CONFIG, GRANT
#d
AT WIZAT

Usage:  at <room | coords | item | mob | player name> <command> <arguments>

AT can be used to perform an action in a location other than where you are
standing. The first argument can be a virtual room number or the name of a
character or object. The remainder of the line is passed to the command
interpreter.

Examples:

  > at 3001 look
  > at dog kill dog
  > at 3.corpse get all corpse
  > at catje wave catje
  > at (0,0) bark  -- There must be no spaces in the coordinates

See also: GOTO
#d
AUTOMESSAGE AUTOMSG

Usage: automessage list
       automessage add <type> [interval] <msg>
       automessage change <id> <property> <new val>
       automessage delete <id>

The automessage system allows you to set messages that will display to all
players at a set time. When you add a one-time or repeating message, there is
a short "grace period" before the message starts displaying. This gives you
time to edit typoes or change your mind and delete the message.

Available types are:
  one-time - Displayed once to each player.
  login - Displayed every time a player logs in.
  repeating - Displayed to each player every <interval> minutes. Players do not
     necessarily all see repeating messages at the same time.

The message will begin with your mud's name in brackets. You can configure the
color of this header with the 'automessage_color' game config.

This command is grantable.

See also: CONFIGURE, GRANT, MESSAGES
#d
AUTOWIZ

Usage:  autowiz

Regenerates the wizlist and godlist.
#d
BAN UNBAN

Usage:  ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
        unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the site
substring from logging in to the game. You may ban a site to ALL, NEW or
SELECT players. Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players from
registering. Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections from
that site. Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok flags
to log in from that site. Ban with no argument returns a list of currently
banned sites.

Unban removes the ban. This command is grantable.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

See also: GRANT, WIZLOCK
#d
BREAKREPLY "BREAK REPLY"

Usage:  breakreply

This command cancels the "reply-to" data for all players in the game who are
lower level than you. It's useful it you want to be invisible and don't want
players to be able to see that you're online using "reply".

See also: REPLY
#d
CLEARABILITIES

Usage:  clearabilities <player> <skill | all>

This command resets the abilities for the target player. They keep their skill
percentages, but may re-purchase all their abilities. You can either target a
specific skill, or "all". This command is grantable.

See also: GRANT, SET
#d
CONFIG

Usage:  config <type> [-v]
        config <type> <key> [value]

This privileged command controls many global game configurations. You can get
view explanations for the configs using the -v option with any set of configs.
Be careful changing global configs, as some of them make powerful changes to
features.

There is no undo button, but all changes are logged.

If you want to experiment with the system, you can change test_config in the
"other" set.
#b
CREATE

Usage:  create [number] <item>

This command allows a god or immortal to create one or more simple items
instantly. Normally, only resources and simple tools can be created this way.
In order to create items, you must have the correct resources available. You
get resources when people sacrifice items to you. Resource counts can be seen
on your score sheet.

See also: SACRIFICE, SCORE
#e
DATE

Shows the current real time. (Not a social)
#d
DC

Usage:  dc <descriptor number>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket. If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground. This command is grantable.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who are stuck in character creation.

See also: GRANT, USERS
#d
DISTANCE

Usage:  distance <location>

This computes the map distance between your current location and any target.
You can target players, coordinates, or anything else you could target with
commands like 'goto'.

The mortal version of this is 'mark'.

See also: MARK
#d
ECHO GECHO SEND

Usage:  echo <message>
        gecho <message>
        send <victim> <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.
GECHO displays the string to everyone in the game.
SEND displays the string to a particular person.

Regular ECHO supports @target and #item just like emote. All three of these
commands are grantable.

Examples:

  > echo Hi, everyone in the room.
  > gecho Hi, everyone in the game, isn't this annoying?
  > send rasmussen You are being watched.

See also: EMOTE, GRANT
#d
EDELETE

Usage:  edelete <empire>

Immortal tool to delete an empire.
#d
EDITNOTES ADDNOTES NOTES "PLAYER NOTES" "ADMIN NOTES" "EDIT NOTES" "ADD NOTES" "SHOW NOTES" AUTONOTES "AUTO NOTES" "TOGGLE AUTONOTES"

Usage:  editnotes <player>
        addnotes <player> <text>
        show notes <player>
        toggle autonotes

You can edit and leave notes about a player, to help inform other immortals
of disciplinary issues or unusual authorizations. Any immortal can see the
notes on any player below his own level, and can only set notes on players
below his own level. Editnotes command is grantable, and includes addnotes.

Editnotes opens a text editor; addnotes just adds a line to the existing notes.
Notes have a 240-character limit; raising this requires converting the player
file.

The autonotes toggle will cause an immortal player to see the "notes" on player
accounts as they log into the game. It shows up immediately after the syslog
for entering the game, only if there are any notes to show.

See also: GRANT
#d
FILE

Usage:  file <file> <lines>

Displays the last X lines of a file in the shell. This is useful for seeing 
recent bad password attempts, ideas, and other information. These are only
parsed out of the syslog when the mud reboots.
#d
FORCE

Usage:  force <victim | all | room> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action. FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room. This command is grantable.

Only the Implementor level can force all/room.

Example:
  > force dog drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look dog

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.

See also: GRANT
#d
FORGIVE

Usage:  forgive <player>

This command forgives the following conditions:
 - hostile flag
 - rogue flag
 - empire defect timer
 - pvp flag cooldown

This command is grantable.

See also: GRANT, sHOSTILE
#d
FREEZE THAW

Usage:  freeze <victim>
        thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented on CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent a
player from playing. If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered by
the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW. Freeze is
grantable, and includes thaw.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: GRANT, SET -> FROZEN
#d
FULLSAVE

Usage:  fullsave

This allows you to force all of the zones in the world to save. They will
only do so if they've been flagged for saves (thus minimizing lag).
#d
GHISTORY "GODHISTORY" "WIZNET HISTORY" WIZHISTORY

Usage:  ghistory

This is the history command for the immortal and god channels.

See also: WIZNET, GODNET
#d
GOD GODS "GOD SYSTEM"

The god system (access level 2) was originally a group of players who could
teleport around the map and create items. Gods were empowered by items that
mortals sacrificed to them, and could only create items using raw materials
from the sacrifices.

There have been no changes, maintenance, or improvements to the god system in
EmpireMUD 2.0 and it is not considered operational. Concerns that would have
to be addressed include:
 - It's currently possible to get infinite resources by creating items that can
   be broken down or crafted into multiple other items, then sacrificing those
   items again.
 - Gods can't be hurt by anyone other than gods, so adventures would be far too
   easy.
#
GODNET

The gods' communication channel.

Usage:  godnet [#level] <test>

See also: GHISTORY
#e
GOTO TRANSFER

Usage:  goto <location>
        transfer <victim|vehicle> [location]

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person (or vehicle)
from wherever they are to the room you're in, or another location. The transfer
command is grantable.

For both GOTO and TRANS, the location specifier can be either a virtual room
number, coordinates, or the name of a character, object, or vehicle.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans dog
  > trans dog 3001
  > trans dog 2.dog

See also: GRANT, POOFIN, POOFOUT, WIZAT
#d
GRANT GRANTS

Usage:  set <name> grants [add | remove] <grants>

Grants allow a player to use commands that are above his or her privilege
level. Grants can be added or removed using the "set" command. Mortals can also
be granted access to some immortal commands, but this isn't always a good idea.
You can see a person's grants by using 'stat' on them.

Most of the grant names correspond to actual commands, but some are special:
 empires - Allows eedit, edelete, moveeinv, and more.
 olc - Allows .olc, vnum, and vstat.
 olc-controls - Allows .setflags, .setminvnum, and .setmaxvnum.
 transfer - Allows moving mortals with commands like transfer and portal.

Try 'helpsearch grantable' to find grantable commands. You can also type
'set <name> grants' with no other arguments to see a list of grants.

#d
HANDBOOK

Usage:  handbook

Guidelines for having an Immortal character -- you should read it.
#d
HASSLE NOHASSLE "NO HASSLE"

Usage:  toggle hassle

Prevents you from activating command triggers and stops mobs from fighting you.
This toggle is also used by some other triggers to check if you're an immortal
who doesn't want to be interfered with.

See also: TOGGLE
#d
HOLYLIGHT "TOGGLE HOLYLIGHT"

Usage:  toggle holylight

A toggle which allows you to see:
   Invisible people and objects, even if you don't have 'detect invisibility'
   Hidden people, even if you don't have 'sense life'
   Dark rooms, even if you don't have a light

It is expected most immortals will keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time; it
exists so that you have the ability to see what mortals see for debugging
purposes.

See also: TOGGLE, WIZHIDE
#d
HOSTILE "HOSTILE COMMAND"

Usage:  hostile <victim>

This immortal command causes a player to be marked as hostile. It should only
be used when someone is doing something that should really allow guards and
other players to attack them, but doesn't. This command is grantable.

You can tell if someone is hostile by doing a 'stat' on them and looking for
the hostile cooldown.

See also: FORGIVE, GRANT, STAT, THIEF
#d
IDLE-OUT IDLEOUT "IDLE OUT"

Usage:  toggle idle-out

This immortal toggle prevents you from being disconnected due to long periods
of inactivity. You can still idle out if you lose your link.

See also: TOGGLE
#d
IMOTD

Usage:  imotd

Displays the Immortal message of the day. This file usually contains new
information on commands recently added, new features and other important
information that immortals should be aware of.

See also: MOTD
#d
INCOGNITO

Usage: toggle incognito

This command prevents you from appearing to mortals on the "who" list. You will
still be visible in your room, and people can still send you tells.

See also: INVIS, TOGGLE, WIZHIDE
#d
INSTANCE INSTANCES

Usage:  instance <list | add | delete | deleteall | nearby | reset | test> [argument]

This command allows immortals to list and manage adventure zone instances.
The 'list' command can be used to see all instances, or all instances for one
adventure zone (vnum). To see only instances near you, use the 'nearby' feature
and, optionally, provide a distance. The instance command is grantable.

The 'delete' command deletes by number in the list.

The 'deleteall' command removes all instances for a given adventure zone
(by vnum).

The 'reset' command will force a zone reset on the instance you're in or the
instance number you target.

The 'test' command will link an instance to the room you're in, using a generic
portal, even if that instance cannot be linked.

See also: GRANT
#d
INVIS INVISIBLE

Usage:  invis [level]

INVIS sets your invisibility level. With no argument, invis toggles between
making you fully visible and fully invisible. If you specify an access level,
only people at and above the level you specify will be able to see you.

Examples:

  > invis
  > invis 3

See also: ACCESS LEVEL, INCOGNITO, INVSTART, VISIBLE, WIZHIDE
#d
INVSTART INVISSTART "INVIS START" "INV START" "START INVISIBLE"

Usage:  set <name> invstart <on | off>

This setting causes a player to be invisible on login, instead of keeping his
or her invisibility setting from the last logout.

If you want to log in invisibly in one login only, type "i" at the MOTD when
prompted to press any key to enter the game.

See also: INVIS, VISIBLE, SET

        island rename <id> <name>
        island flags <id> [add | remove] <flags>

This immortal command allows the game's staff to name islands and apply
properties to them. This command is grantable.

Island flags:
 NEWBIE - Wipes claims periodically
 !AGGRO - Prevents aggro mobs, and guard towers won't fire

See also: GRANT
#d
LAST

Usage:  last <player_name>

For checking the last time a person logged on, their sitename, and their ID
number.

See also: STAT
#d
LOAD

Usage:  load <type> <virtual number>

LOAD is used to create instances of mobs, objects, and vehicles. The first
argument specifies what type you are trying to load; the second is the virtual
number. This command is grantable.

(For the mortal command, try LOAD VEHICLE.)

You can load: mob, obj, vehicle

Example:

  > load obj 1
  You create a bulletin board.

  > load mob 1
  You create a snarling wolf.

See also: GRANT, VNUM
#d
MOVEEINV "MOVE EINV" "MOVE EMPIRE INVENTORY"

Usage:  moveeinv "<empire>" <from island> <to island>

This command allows an immortal to move an empire's inventory from one island
to another. All stored items one on island are transferred to the other.

You can use 'show islands <empire>' to see which island ids have items stored.

This command is meant to be used to fix problems for mortals, not to assist
them in moving around the world. It should only be treated as a repair tool.

See also: EINV, SHOW
#d
MUTE

Usage:  mute <victim>

MUTE is used to shut a player up. When muted, a player will not be able to
use most communication channels until he/she is unmuted. This command is
grantable.

See also: FLAGS, GRANT
#d
NOCUSTOMIZE !CUSTOMIZE "NO CUSTOMIZE"

Usage:  set <name> nocustomize <on | off>

been abusing it. This is an account-wide setting.

See also: SET
#d
NOTITLE

Usage:  notitle <vicitim>

Prevent players from being able to set their own titles; i.e., if the player
consistently has an offensive title. The definition of offensive is left as
an exercise for the reader.

Notitle also prevents the player from changing their empire name, empire
adjective, and the names of empire ranks.

See also: TITLE
#d
NOWIZNET "NO WIZNET"

Usage:  toggle wiznet

Allows you to hear or ignore messages coming over the wiznet.

See also: WIZNET, TOGGLE
#d
OSET "RESTRING OBJECT"

Usage:  oset <object> <field> <value>

This command lets you modify an item in the world. It does not change the
item's prototype; to do that you must use OLC. This command is grantable.

You can change the following fields:
  flags - Item flags like FAST and HARD-DROP.
  keywords - The words that can be used to target the object.
  longdescription - The text shown on the ground.
  shortdescription - The text used to build strings, and in the inventory.
  timer - The decay timer on the item (-1 for no decay).

Setting the keywords, longdescription, or shortdescription to "none" will
restore its strings from the prototype (if one exists).

See also: GRANT, OEDIT
#d
PAGE

Usage:  page <player | all> <message>

PAGE is used to send a message, along with a beep, to another player. Use
PAGE ALL to send a message and a beep to everyone in the game. This command is
grantable.

Examples:

  > page rasmussen Hey, are you still at the keyboard?
  > page all GAME WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN IN 10 MINUTES

Do not abuse this command.

See also: GRANT
#d
PLAYERDELETE "PLAYER DELETE" "DELETE PLAYER"

Usage:  playerdelete <name> CONFIRM

This command deletes a player completely. It cannot be used on players with
the !DEL flag set. There is no way to undo this command (unless your EmpireMUD
keeps backups of mud files). You must type the word 'CONFIRM' as the second
argument, in all capital letters. This command also cannot be abbreviated.

This command is grantable.

See also: GRANT, SELFDELETE
#d
POOFIN POOFOUT

Usage:  poofin <message | none>
        poofout <message | none>

Sets the message seen by players when you use GOTO to move to a different
room. POOFIN with no argument displays your poofin (the default is "appears
with an ear-splitting bang"); POOFOUT defaults to "disappears in a puff of
smoke."

If you want your name in the middle of the poofin/out message, instead of at
the beginning, you can use the $n token to place it anywhere. If you don't
use the $n token, your name will appear at the beginning.

You can remove your poofin or poofout with the "none" command.

Example:
 > poofin There is a blinding flash of light, and $n appears!
 > goto Foo
 There is a blinding flash of light, and Bob appears!

See also: GOTO
#e
PURGE

Usage:  purge [name]

Purge destroys things. If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players or vehicles. If the argument is
an object, that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed. If
the argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory
and equipment lying on the ground. This command is grantable.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection. For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

You can also purge vehicles this way, but the no-argument room purge will
ignore them. Anything inside a purged vehicle will be lost.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

See also: DC, GRANT
#d
RANDOM

Usage:  random

This is used to go to a random room on the world map. It's very useful for
finding new places to build an island.
#d
REBOOT

Usage:  reboot [now | minutes]

You can use this to either trigger an instant reboot, or count one down. 
Because this is a reboot and saves everything, no information is ever lost.
However, players also enjoy some warning and may appreciate knowing that
you're going to reboot. It may also interrupt their fighting.

To reboot immediately, use the 'now' option. Otherwise, typing it with no
arguments displays the current status. This command is grantable.

See also: GRANT
#d
RELOAD

Usage:  reload < '*' | all | file >

Reload is used to reload text files such as the MOTD from disk into memory. 
Reload * reloads all the text files below. This command is grantable.

Valid files are:

  credits    (/mud_dir/lib/text/credits)
  intros     (/mud_dir/lib/text/intros/*)
  handbook   (/mud_dir/lib/text/handbook)
  help       (/mud_dir/lib/text/help)
  immlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/immlist)
  imotd      (/mud_dir/lib/text/imotd)
  news       (/mud_dir/lib/text/news)
  motd       (/mud_dir/lib/text/motd)
  info       (/mud_dir/lib/text/info)
  policy     (/mud_dir/lib/text/policies)
  wizlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/wizlist)
  xhelp      (/mud_dir/lib/text/help/*)
  data       (/mud_dir/lib/misc/game_data)

See also: GRANT
#d
RESCALE

Usage:  rescale <thing> <level>

This command allows you to rescale a mob, item, or vehicle. It checks for a
matching mob in the room first, then a vehicle, then an item in your inventory,
then an item on the ground. This command is grantable.

The level you choose will still be constrained by the mob/item's minimum and
maximum scale value.

Caution: Rescaling an item will almost always cause it to be re-loaded and it
will lose any enchantments or modifications.

See also: GRANT
#d
RESTORE

Usage:  restore <player | mobile>

RESTORE restores a player or mobile to full hit, mana, and movement points.
It also resets all cooldowns. This command is grantable.

If used on immortals, it also sets all skill levels to 100 and grants all
abilities (on the first skill set only).

See also: GRANT, SKILL SWAP
#d
RETURN

Usage:  return

RETURN returns you to your regular body if you are switched into a mob.

See also: SWITCH
#d
ROOMFLAGS "TOGGLE ROOMFLAGS" "ROOM FLAGS"

Usage:  toggle roomflags

This immortal toggle allows you to see flags and vnums on the "look" command.

See also: TOGGLE
#d
SET

Usage:  set [file | player] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles. This command is grantable.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on. If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost. If you wish to set a
player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the FILE
argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:
