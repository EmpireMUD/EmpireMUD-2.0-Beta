CLASS "CLASS SKILLS" "CLASS ROLE" ROLE

When you specialize two skills past 75, they become your "class skills" and
you are assigned a class. Your class determines how large your health, move,
and mana pools are. It also gives you some new abilities once you reach 100
in both your class skills.

Usage:  class [role <type>]

The class command shows your current class, role, and class abilities. You
can also use this command to change roles. For example, "class role tank".
You must have a role in order to gain your class's abilities, even if all of
its roles share them.

Class roles are the different tasks a class might be suited for. For example,
if your class has both Natural Magic and Survival as its core skills, it might
be suited to melee damage, caster damage, or healing. You can't perform all
roles at the same time. You can change your current role using the "class role"
command.

&yTank&0: Takes all the damage in combat.
&rMelee&0: Does physical damage.
&aCaster&0: Does magical damage.
&jHealer&0: Keeps the group alive.
&mUtility&0: Doesn't fight; builds or crafts instead.
&wSolo&0: For playing alone; some abilities won't work in groups.

The colors shown above are used to display class roles on "who" and "roster".

TANK TANKING "TANK ROLE" "TANKING ROLE" "TANK TRAITS" "TANKING ROLE"

The tank is the group member who takes damage from the enemy. A good tank has
high hitpoints and damage mitigation (like resistance and dodge). Tanks don't
need Strength or Wits, because those are related to dealing damage. When
choosing gear, potions, and buffs for your tank character, you only need to
worry about the tank traits listed below

The class names of tanks appear in &yyellow&0 on the "who" list and the
empire roster.

Tanking tips:
 - The tank should start combat with all mobs so they are hitting him, rather
   than hitting other players.
 - The tank should use abilities like Rescue to ensure "squishy" roles like the
   healer are not taking damage.

Tank traits:
 - Dexterity: Contributes to Dodge and counteracts the attacker's Dexterity.
 - Dodge: You should be as close to the dodge cap for your level as possible.
 - Block: You should be as close to the block cap for your level as possible,
