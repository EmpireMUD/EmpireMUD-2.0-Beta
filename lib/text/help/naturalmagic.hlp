"NATURAL MAGIC" "CHANT OF DRUIDS"

Natural Magic (skill)

Core traits: Intelligence, Wits, Mana

Deep in the mysteries of the world lies a flow of mana that slithers and
snakes its way through every living thing. It is in the sun above us, the
grass beneath us, and the seas beyond the horizon. By embracing your own
connection to nature, you can tap into this mana and wield the mighty fury
that is Natural Magic.

The druids of old knew a secret chant that would bring your body in line
with the movement of the mana of the world. Some say that if you build a
monument to the druids -- a great stone henge -- you can find the inspir-
ation, chant the sacred words, and unlock your natural potential.
