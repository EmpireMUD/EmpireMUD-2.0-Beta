"NATURAL MAGIC" "CHANT OF DRUIDS"

Natural Magic (skill)

Core traits: Intelligence, Wits, Mana

Deep in the mysteries of the world lies a flow of mana that slithers and
snakes its way through every living thing. It is in the sun above us, the
grass beneath us, and the seas beyond the horizon. By embracing your own
connection to nature, you can tap into this mana and wield the mighty fury
that is Natural Magic.

The druids of old knew a secret chant that would bring your body in line
with the movement of the mana of the world. Some say that if you build a
monument to the druids -- a great stone henge -- you can find the inspir-
ation, chant the sacred words, and unlock your natural potential.

"ANCESTRAL HEALING"

Ancestral Healing
Class ability:  Luminary

This passive ability channels the power of your ancestors to add your Greatness
attribute to your Bonus-Healing trait, which affects all of your healing
abilities. This Greatness effect gets more powerful as your level goes up.

The amount of Bonus-Healing added is a proportion of your Greatness: your total
Greatness is added per 150 player levels, with a proportion of your Greatness
for any potion under 150 levels. For example, if you are level 75, you gain
half your Greatness. At level 150, it's your full Greatness. At level 300, it's
2x Greatness.

Note: Bonus healing does not add to the cost of healing spells.
