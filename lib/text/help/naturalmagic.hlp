"NATURAL MAGIC" NAT "CHANT OF DRUIDS"

Natural Magic (skill)

Core traits: Intelligence, Wits, Mana

Deep in the mysteries of the world lies a flow of mana that slithers and
snakes its way through every living thing. It is in the sun above us, the
grass beneath us, and the seas beyond the horizon. By embracing your own
connection to nature, you can tap into this mana and wield the mighty fury
that is Natural Magic.

The druids of old knew a secret chant that would bring your body in line
with the movement of the mana of the world. Some say that if you build a
monument to the druids -- a great stone henge -- you can find the inspir-
ation, chant the sacred words, and unlock your natural potential.

You get additional Natural Magic abilities when you reach level 100, depending
on which other skills you have at high levels. Use the 'role' command to choose
which set of skills to use.

Greatness is added per 150 player levels, with a proportion of your Greatness
for any portion under 150 levels. For example, if you are level 75, you gain
half your Greatness. At level 150, it's your full Greatness. At level 300, it's

Cost:  50 move (150 in combat)

The werewolf form is a light, quick morph that works well for solo and pvp
players, as it doesn't have the penalties of the role-based forms (but its
bonuses are also lower).

WORM

Worm (Natural Magic ability)

Usage:  worm <direction>
        worm look

Particularly powerful nature mages can move while earthmelded, worming their
way through the ground. You cannot worm through water tiles, and you cannot
emerge in buildings (except open-air buildings).

Your tie to nature is important while worming. If you spend time underneath
a closed building, you will begin to take damage from nature burn. You stop
taking nature burn damage as soon as you end your earthmeld.

Gains experience as you move around underground.
