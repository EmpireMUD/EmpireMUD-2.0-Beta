"EMPIRE GUIDE"

Quickstart Guide: Empires

Once you have claimed a square of land on the map, your character will auto-
matically found an empire. By default, the empire has the same name as your
character.

You can tell who owns a piece of land because it says the name underneath the
map. It may also say the land is unclaimable, which usually means you're too
close to a starting location. You can claim land anywhere that isn't already
claimed, but you'll only be able to found a CITY if you're far enough away
from starting locations and other cities. The NEARBY command will tell you if
you're close to those.

The mud's website has a graphical map that can help you find areas that aren't
owned. You can also use TOGGLE POLITICAL to see which map tiles are claimed at
a distance.

You don't need to found a city yet, but you will be limited on how much land
you can claim that isn't in a city. To find out what your claim limits are,
type "empire <name>" (using the name of your character or empire). There is a
line on that display that says "Territory: XXX in cities, YYY/ZZZ outside".
If you reach your claim limit, you won't be able to claim more land. The
TERRITORY help file has more information on gaining territory. It can also be
used to find places you claimed that you might not want any more.

Once you've started your empire, you should use EEDIT to get it set up:
 > eedit name <name> - Change the full name of the empire.
 > eedit adjective <name> - Change the "adjective form" of the name.
 > eedit banner <color code> - See HELP COLORS for a list of color codes.
 > eedit rank 2 <rank name> - Rename your leader rank.
 
Your empire adjective should be relatively short, as it's used to build some
sentences. If your empire is "The Grand and Eternal House of Valerie", you
might choose "Valerien" as your adjective form. This will be used for things
like minting "Valerien coins", or sentences like "You are in the Valerien city
of Oroborous."

You can change the number of ranks in your empire, and give names to each rank.
However, this usually isn't important until you have more members. You can also
set PRIVILEGE levels to restrict some actions to certain ranks in your empire.

When you're ready to found your first city, find a good location with nothing
around it on the NEARBY display. You'll want to be at least 30 tiles from any
other city or starting location. CITY FOUND will start a city at your current
location.

You can recruit additional members for your empire on the /recruit channel,
but you may still want to roleplay the introduction and invitation when you
meet up with them.

If you make any alts (other characters on the same account; see POLICY for
rules), you can add them to your own empire by having them PLEDGE to it, then
switching back to your empire leader and using ENROLL and PROMOTE. These
characters don't have to be online at the same time. These are also the
commands that other players will use to join.

As you build houses, you will see citizens move in to live in your empire. You
can even put them to work after unlocking the WORKFORCE technology. Unlocking
technologies is also a good way to earn more territory.

Other important empire commands: ROSTER, ESAY, ELOG, EEDIT, CITY

"HOUSING GUIDE"

Quickstart Guide: Your First House

Now that you have spent some time in the wilderness learning basic SURVIVAL and
how to CRAFT some simple tools, it is probably a good time to find a suitable
home. A CABIN is an easy way to start.

The first step in any building project is choosing an appropriate location. For
the CABIN, this will eventually require two adjoining map tiles which are both
open plains. You will need one tile for the CABIN to occupy and another for the
entrance to face. If you want to place your building in the woods, you can
clear out the necessary space during the next phase.

Once you've picked a nice spot, you will need your building materials. Typing
HELP CABIN reveals that you will need a total of 6 logs for construction. That
means you will need to find some trees, which are hopefully not too far away.
You will want to make sure to WIELD your trusty axe and proceed to CHOP while
in a forest tile. A fully grown forest tile will provide 4 trees, so you will
have to clear out 2 map tiles of dense forest for all of the material. If you
are building your CABIN in the woods, these two tiles can be for placement of
the building.

After chopping down 6 trees, you will want to SCRAPE TREE to convert the trees
into logs and sticks. After all the scraping, you will end up with six logs
and maybe two dozen sticks. If you can't hold all the materials, you'll want
to move them to the construction site in preparation for the BUILD.

Now you should be at the intended construction site with all 6 logs present
in your inventory or on the ground. Make sure the tile is cleared of any trees
and also that there is a neighboring tile open in the direction of the intended
entrance. When everything is ready, type BUILD CABIN [X], where [X] is the
direction you'd like the entrance to face. If you have not yet done so, this
action will also CLAIM the tile where you stand.

Once all the logs have been put in place, your construction will be complete
and you will have your very first house! Use the HOME command to set this as
your home, and you'll be able to use a HESTIAN TRINKET to teleport back.

"IRON GUIDE" "MINING GUIDE" "FORGE GUIDE"

To Arms! Out of the Stone Age
Using Iron Ore: Foundry, Mine & Forge

The trusty stone axe has been a blessed companion so far. It chops. It scrapes.
It skins. It slices and it dices. It's a weapon, and a tool. In many ways, it
has been your best friend. Nevertheless, you'll want to invest in bigger and
better tools eventually, and that will require a lot of iron ore.

Like stone and lumber, ore is an essential resource, but unlike those two, iron
ore is a little harder to obtain. Rocks and trees are just dug up or chopped
down and taken to storage, but mining ore involves constructing a building at
the site, just to extract it. Iron ore is only found in mountain tiles, and you
must BUILD MINE to get at it.

{FF}
Before that, you'll want to make sure you've got a place to smelt all that iron
ore you plan on mining. BUILD FOUNDRY requires 20 sticks (type HELP FOUNDRY)
and this building will let you store your iron ore, as well as melt it down
to ingots. This means that, if your MINE will be quite a distance from your
main settlement, you can build a second FOUNDRY in which to deposit the mined
ore and it will be accessible from the first. Typing INVENTORY in the FOUNDRY
will let you see your empire's ore and ingot supply. RETRIEVE and STORE will
let you take and deposit ore, respectively. SMELT ORE will let you turn two
iron ore into one iron ingot.

&y/&0[]&y\&0
When you are ready to BUILD MINE, make sure you have the 4 required logs
(type HELP MINE). You'll want to find a mountain tile on the edge of a range,
so that the MINE's entrance can face an open plains tile. Once the MINE is
finished, you can use the MINE command to begin looking for ore. The question
that inevitably comes up at this point is "How do I mine without a pick?" You
need iron to make a pick, and you can't get the iron without the pick!

That stone axe of ours was made by the CRAFT command, with a handaxe and a
handle. Instead of turning it into an axe, we can also WIELD a handaxe and use
it for mining. If you need to, craft another handaxe by chipping one rock 
against another. WIELD HANDAXE, then MINE until there's no ore left. Sometimes,
you come across gold dust while mining ore, or perhaps the entire mine is full
of silver instead of iron. Silver nuggets and gold dust can be stored in your
empire's vault, which will increase its wealth rating. They can also be used in
the FORGE, which will be discussed here shortly. When the MINE is finally
depleted, DISMANTLE it so that the mountain tile can eventually replenish
itself. Start another MINE along the mountain range in the meantime.

[FF]
You'll need to get your empire's iron flowing before you BUILD FORGE, because
this building requires 10 logs, 15 rocks, and 10 iron ingots (type HELP FORGE).
Once constructed, however, you will be able to FORGE ingots into various tools,
weapons, and armor, according to your skill level. You can make jewelry and
special items with gold and silver, and the FORGE (or FOUNDRY) is also where
you SMELT these valuable metals into coins or bars. Similar to the mining
issue, the question inevitably comes up at this stage: "how do I forge a hammer
without a hammer to forge?"

You can CRAFT a simple stone hammer with the CRAFT command, out of a rock and a
handle. Note that you will need to CRAFT HANDLE from a stick also, for each
handled tool you wish to make. This stone hammer is good, but you'll want
to FORGE a better hammer eventually, which will help you forge gear faster.
When you've finished your first hammer, WIELD HAMMER to FORGE some more useful
things. Typing FORGE by itself will list the items that you are capable of 
making. FORGE PICK to help you MINE, FORGE SHOVEL to help when you DIG, and you
can even FORGE AXE to replace that stone age one you've been using.

"VAMPIRE GUIDE"

Quickstart Guide: Being a Vampire

This is a getting-started guide for vampires. If you want to find out how to
become a vampire, or are looking for information on the Vampire skill, you
should check HELP VAMPIRE. Any words in all-caps in this file will also have
their own help files, if you want more information.

Blood Upkeep:
A vampire loses blood over time. New vampires lose 1 point of blood every tick
no matter what, but more experienced vampires can shut off their active powers
in order to reduce their blood upkeep all the way to 0. Each active power will
raise your blood upkeep. Usually you can see your active powers by typing
AFFECTS.

Getting Blood:
Vampires must feed off of other creatures to survive. Until you have an ability
like COMMAND, you'll need to incapacitate your food before you can BITE it.
The easiest way to do this is TOGGLE AUTOKILL, which will cause you to knock
enemies out instead of killing them. (You can use EXECUTE to finish them off
if you don't plan to bite them.) Players can freely allow you to bite them
using TOGGLE BOTHER -- they must be botherable.

Avoiding the Sun:
Vampires in EmpireMUD don't burn in the sun, but it does block them from using
any of their powers. If you step into a sunny area, any active powers will
shut themselves off. If you're trapped outdoors, you'll find yourself without
your useful Vampire abilities. You can still use your powers indoors during the
day.

Prompt:
You can use the following PROMPT or DISPLAY codes related to being a vampire:
   %b - current blood        %t - time
   %B - maximum blood        %c - conditions
