COLOSSUS "CLOCKWORK COLOSSUS" "CLOCK WORK COLOSSUS"

Clockwork Colossus (level 100-200 adventure)

A towering clockwork man stomps across the landscape, paying little attention
to what he might step on -- if it is a he -- as he marches inexorably toward an
unseen goal. Few have ever beheld such a marvel as this colossus, and fewer
still have managed to fell one and see what makes it tick.

This adventure has 6 difficulty settings. To lower the difficulty of the
colossus, you must 'board' it and sabotage its massive metal mechanisms. Each
piece lowers the difficulty by one level, with the exception of the feet.
Disabling the feet will return the colossus to its scaffolding, where you can
summon fellow adventurers to aid in the fight.

You can 'disembark' from the colossus at any time, but be careful not to let
it throw you off from great height. The colossus shoots powerful laser beams
from its eyes, so be prepared to type 'dodge'.

The goblin junk dealer sells:
 enchanted brass bolt - crafting item
 little brass cannonballs schematic - craft ammunition for a special weapon
 clockwork magpie whistle - mini-pet
 clockwork elephant whistle - land mount
 clockwork eagle whistle - flying mount

"OLD GODS" "BINDING CIRCLE"

{**}

The Binding Circle adventures are a set of small 1-fight world spawns where
you fight and defeat ancient, long-forgotten gods. These adventures spawn only
on continents (not smaller islands) and you can find them with 'nearby'. Once
you find the broken binding circle, the chains there will give you a hint as
to which old god you're looking for. Use the 'where' command to find that god
and hunt it down.

Alternatively, you can build your own binding circle (using rewards from these
adventures). Your binding circle has a chance to bind one of the old gods
whenever the Binding Circle adventures spawn. The binding circle is not
guaranteed to bind a god each time, but can be reused over and over again.

All Old Gods adventures use the 'weight of the old gods' currency.

  Anat, the warrior-goddess - HELP ANAT
  Ba'al Hadad, the storm god - HELP HADAD
