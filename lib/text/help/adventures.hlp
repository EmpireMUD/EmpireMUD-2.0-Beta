"OLD GODS" "BINDING CIRCLE"

{**}

The Binding Circle adventures are a set of small 1-fight world spawns where
you fight and defeat ancient, long-forgotten gods. These adventures spawn only
on continents (not smaller islands) and you can find them with 'nearby'. Once

to which old god you're looking for. Use the 'where' command to find that god
and hunt it down.

Alternatively, you can build your own binding circle (using rewards from these
adventures). Your binding circle has a chance to bind one of the old gods
whenever the Binding Circle adventures spawn. The binding circle is not
guaranteed to bind a god each time, but can be reused over and over again.

All Old Gods adventures use the 'weight of the old gods' currency.

The following old gods are available so far:
  Anat, the warrior-goddess - HELP ANAT
  Ba'al Hadad, the storm god - HELP HADAD
