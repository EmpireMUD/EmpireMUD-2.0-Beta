! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard. You can also repeat
any of your last 5 commands by abbreviating the one you want to repeat. For
example, '!w' might repeat your last whois.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string. The syntax
is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"

Examples:

  > tell rasmusen Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.

  > ^rasmusen^rasmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

  > ^you^you doing^
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

+ - -- "INPUT QUEUE" "COMMAND QUEUE" "INPUT LAG" "COMMAND LAG" QUEUE

The + and - commands allow you to manipulate your input queue. Some commands,
such as abilities, cause a small amount of "command lag". Anything you type
while you have this "lag" is added to the end of your input queue. Normal
command lag is 1.25 seconds for abilities, but some traits can lower this.

You can add a new command to the start of your input queue (instead of the
end of the queue) using a +. For example, "+heal" will put "heal" at the start
of your queue.

You can see your current queue by typing -.

You can clear your entire queue with --, or you can remove specific items with
"-text" where text is an abbreviation for the commands to remove. For example,
"-kick" will remove anything that starts with "kick".

#
ALIAS ALIASES

Usage:  alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases. Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias. The alias name must
be one word. The command can be any string. Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively. Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively. The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem kill $1; bash $2
  > killem deer cow

Would attack a deer, followed by bashing a cow. Variables may be used
repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem assist $1; bash $2; bash $2

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

#
ALT ALTERNATE "ALT LIST" ALTS

Usage:  alt <name>
        alt list
        alt import <name> <field | all>

This command lets you switch from one alt to another. An "alt" is a character
you own, on your account. You can only use this command to switch between
characters on the same account. No password is required.

Players will only see the login/logout messages unless they are in the same
empire as both your alts, in which case they will see a "switch" message.
However, if this EmpireMUD has public logins enabled, alternate will always
give a "switch" mortlog (instead of elogs).

You can't use alternate again within 60 seconds of a previous use. Please don't
spam players by logging in and out more rapidly than this.

You can't alt (or quit) in hostile territory. You can choose to disconnect
instead, but this will leave your character vulnerable.

You should read the multiplaying/alts rules on the POLICY command for more
information on these rules.

See also: QUIT, ALT IMPORT
#
"ALT IMPORT" "ALTERNATE IMPORT" "IMPORT FROM ALTS"

Usage:  alt import <name> <field | all>

You can use the alt command to import some preferences and features from your
other characters. In most cases, these will be merged with the ones you already
have. For example, if you have an alias named "foo" and you import aliases, it
won't overwrite the "foo" you already have with one from an alt.

You can import: aliases, prompt, fprompt, preferences, fightmessages, recolors,
slash-channels, and ignores.

"Preferences" will import some toggles, as well as mapsize.

#
ANSI COLOR COLORS MAPCOLOR "MAP COLOR" MAP-COLOR &&

Options:  toggle map-color

See also: CUSTOMIZE BUILDING, CUSTOMIZE ISLAND, TEXT EDITOR
#
"CUSTOMIZE ISLAND"

Usage:  customize island name <name | none>

This command allows your empire to name an island. You can only name islands
where you have an established city. Each empire can have its own name for an
island, in addition to its global (default) name.

You cannot remove the global name from an island, even if you set its name to
'none'.

There are three ways an island name can become that island's global name:
Discovery (the first empire to name an unexplored island sets its global name)
Sole ownership (if yours is the only empire with a city on the island)
Consensus (if all empires with cities on the island use the same name for it)

Only discovery changes an island's global name immediately; all other changes
only happen at the beginning of a new MUD year.
#

requires the same permissions as the "ship" command, and it requires an
available worker (citizen) at the location you want to dispatch the ship from.

same island. (This command always prefers ships in your current room.) The
destination island must have docks to receive the ship.

#
DOUSE BURNING "PUT OUT FIRE" "FIRE BRIGADE"

Usage:  douse [vehicle]

In the event of a fire, you may douse it with water from any portable source. 
It may take a lot of water to douse the fire, and you may have to leave and 
come back. If you don't fully douse it, the flames will slowly rise again, 
and destroy your structure.

leave things laying around, though, or the might not be there when you get
back.

When dropping coins, if you don't specify an empire, it will default to your 
generic coins. If you need to use an empire with a multi-word name, put it in
"quotes". You can use the empire's full name, adjective name, or number.

EAT DRINK SIP TASTE

Usage:  eat <item>

        sip [from] <item>

If you're hungry or thirsty, these commands are for you! You can drink from
wells, fountains, and the edge of nearby rivers, too.

Being hungry or thirsty causes you to regenerate health, moves, and mana more
slowly. It will also slow down any action you take, such as chopping or
sailing. If you can no longer regenerate moves due to hunger, try sleeping.

Examples:
  > eat bread
  > taste bread
  > drink from cup

Usage:  fightmessages [type]
        fmessages all <on | off>

Usage:  fill <item> [from] well
        fill <item> [from] fountain
        fill <item> river

well in the same room as you. You can also fill it from a river in the same
room or an adjacent room.

Usage:  get <object>
        take all [object]
        take all all.<container>
        get all.<object> all.<container>

If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick
it up. 'get' can also be used to extract items from containers. Some vehicles
also act as containers, such as carts and ships. You can get items from a
ship's cargo hold while inside the ship.

Examples:

  > get sword corpse
  > get all corpse
  > get all all.bag
  > get all.bread all.bag
  > get all caravel

See also: DROP, KEEP, PUT
#

If you need to use an empire with a multi-word name, put it in "quotes". You
can use the empire's full name, adjective name, or number.

#
GRAB HOLD

Usage:  grab <object>
        hold <object>

        group leave  -- leave the group you're in
        group leader <name>  -- change leader
        group new -- create an empty group

Grouping allows multiple players to work on the same challenge, and gives them
access to a private group channel. You can also type "group" by itself to see
the status of all members.

Unlike older CircleMUDs, EmpireMUD does not require that you be following a
player to group with them, and members don't have to be present for you to
invite them to the group.

There is a limit of 4 members in a group at a time. This is intended to help
balance game encounters against the number of players in the group.

Inviting a player to a group automatically beckons them to follow, if they
aren't already following someone.

#
GSAY GTELL PSAY PTELL

Usage:  gsay <message>
        gtell <message>

Usage:  junk <object>
        junk <number> [empire] coins

Use JUNK instead of DROP if you want to keep the world a little cleaner. If
you JUNK something, it will disappear.

When junking coins, if you don't specify an empire, it will default to your 
generic coins. If you need to use an empire with a multi-word name, put it in
"quotes". You can use the empire's full name, adjective name, or number.

Examples:

  > junk cup
  > junk all.bronze

#
LAY ROAD ROADS

Roads: ----  ..|.  ..+-  --+.  .--.

Roads (Empire)
Usage:  lay
Cost:  20x (rock)

You may use this ability to lay rocks into the ground to form a cobblestone 
road. Roads eliminate the small movement lag that you normally get while
walking. They can aid in tree and crop control -- nothing will grow over the
roads, but they will eventually decay if left unclaimed.

The lay command is also used to pull up a road and retrieve half its rocks.

The Roads ability also allows you to put up road signs, if you specialize in
the Empire skill.

Roads count as their base terrain for most building functions, so you can
build things facing roads, and can usually build right over a road -- but the
road underneath will be lost. Roads count as in-city territory as far away as
3x a city's normal radius.

Gain experience when you lay a road (but not on mountains) or put down a
road sign.

#
LEARN LEARNED LEARNING

Usage:  learn <recipe>
        learned [search terms]

You can learn a recipe (including patterns, schematics, and designs) from an
item that teaches it. This gives you permanent access to that craft recipe
(although you must still meet any skill and level requirements).

Learning a recipe will consume the recipe item.

You can see your learned recipes with the 'learned' command and, optionally,
can filter the results.

#
LOAD LOADVEHICLE "LOAD VEHICLE" BOATLOAD "BOAT LOAD"

Usage:  load <mob | vehicle | all> <onto vehicle>

This command allows you to load animals and vehicles onto other vehicles, such
as ships. To store items in vehicles, use "put <item> <vehicle>" instead.

This command was formerly called "boatload".

See also: UNLOAD, BOARD, PUT, SAIL, SHIPS
#
LOOK EXAMINE

Usage:  look
        look [in | at] [the] <item>
        look <direction>
        look out

For studying your surroundings. Examine will look at an object and, if it's a
container, also show you its contents.

Examples:

  > look                                      
  > look AT the cow
  > look IN the bag
  > look south (lets you see who is to the south of you)

Note that if you LOOK AT CORPSE you will not see its inventory.
To see what's inside a container (i.e. a corpse) use LOOK IN <object>.

See also: GET, READ, TAKE, SURVEY
#
MAPSIZE "MAP SIZE"

Usage:  mapsize <size | auto>

This allows you to change the size of your map display to better fit the size
of your screen. Be cautious with large mapsizes because some people are dis-
connected when the game tries to send too much data to their telnet client.

Mapsize is the total width of your map in map tiles (4 characters if you're
using the ascii map; one room if you're using screen-reader mode). The number
is always odd because you sit in the center of it. A mapsize of 3 shows 1 tile
in each direction; a mapsize of 15 (standard) shows 7 in each direction.

If you set your mapsize to 'auto', the game will attempt to detect the size of
your client window.

When you move very fast on the map, your mapsize will start to shrink as it
becomes more difficult for your character to pay attention to all his/her
surroundings (and saves the game time rendering large views repeatedly). You
can restore your original mapsize if you stop and type 'look', or wait a few
seconds.

#
MAIL CHECK RECEIVE SEND "PIGEON MAIL"

Usage:  mail check
        mail send <person>
        mail receive [amount]

mail from a pigeon post, but you can check and receive mail from anywhere.

Examples:

  To check and see if you have any mail waiting:
  > mail check

  To write mail to Niandra:
  > mail send Niandra

  To ask for your mail, if you have any waiting:
  > mail receive 1
  > mail receive

PORTAL PORTALS ENTER

Building:  ~&b][&0~ portal  20 logs, 12 blocks, 20 nexus crystal  (High Sorcery ability)
Built on:  plains, desert
Fame:  1
Commands:  portal [destination]
           portal -all
           enter <portal>

You can open a portal between two portal buildings, so long as you have per-
mission to use both buildings. The portal will stay open for a few minutes.
You can target the portal building on the other end using either its co-
ordinates, or the name of a person who is at the other side.

Portals have a maximum distance of 50 tiles unless both ends are in a city.

You can portal to specific coordinates by using parentheses (123, 456) or by
typing the coordinates with no space -- 123,456 -- but you can target your
own and allied portals by number.

Typing "portal" with no argument will list portals belonging to your empire
and its allies. Typing "portal -all" will list all public portals belonging
to other empires. Only places you could portal to from here are listed. You can
target empire and ally portals by portal number, but the -all list can't be
targeted this way.

Portals can only connect two locations on the same land mass (continent or
island) unless your empire has a Portal Master. You can't open a portal at all
if there isn't at least a Portal Mage.

You can't enter a portal of any kind if it's on a tile you don't have
permission to use, such as one owned by an enemy empire. Infiltrate can get
around this (you still use the 'enter' command).

Immortals can open portals between any two locations.

#
"PORTAL SICKNESS" "PORTALING SICKNESS" "PORTALLING SICKNESS"

Portal sickness is caused by entering magical portals (specifically, portals
created between portal buildings). If you have too much portal sickness, you
can't enter a portal.

Portals normally cause one minute of portal sickness. If you portal again
before it wears off, you'll get five minutes of portal sickness instead. After
that, you can portal again as soon as your portal sickness is below one minute.
You can see your current portal sickness by typing 'cooldowns'.

Portal mages only get four minutes of portal sickness instead of five. City-to-
city portals cause just two minutes instead of five.

Only entering portals causes portal sickness. You can still open portals while
you have portal sickness.

See also: COOLDOWNS, ENTER, PORTALS, PORTAL MAGE
#
POUR

Usage:  pour <from container> <to container>
        pour <from container> out

If you want to pour some liquid from one container to another. Pouring
out simply empties the contents of the container onto the ground.

If you pour water out in a trench that has been fully excavated, this will
help it fill up faster.

Examples:

  > pour canteen cup
  > pour cup out

See also: FILL, TRENCH
#
PROMPT FPROMPT "FIGHT PROMPT" "COMBAT PROMPT"

Usage:  prompt <string | off | default>
        fprompt <string | off | default>

The prompt is the text you see when the game is waiting for you to do
something, and it's usually right next to where you type (but some mud clients
put typing in its own field). You can use the default prompt, which shows how
injured and tired you are. Or you can choose your own prompt.

You can also set an fprompt, which is used only when you are in combat. It may
be different from your regular prompt. Using "fprompt default" will cause you
to see your normal prompt in combat.

Typing "prompt off" will remove your prompt entirely, and "prompt default"
will restore your default prompt.

The base prompt is: &&0|%i/%u [&&y%C&&0]> 

Here are the prompt codes and what they do:
  %h  Current health      %v  Current moves      %m  Current mana
  %H  Maximum health      %V  Maximum moves      %M  Maximum mana
  %i  Health text         %u  Move text          %n  Mana text
  
  %b  Current blood       %t  Time
  %B  Maximum blood       %a  Current action
  %d  Blood text          %_  Line break
  
  %e  % health of enemy   %f  % health of enemy's focus (the tank)
                          %F  Current/total health of enemy's focus (if player)
  
  %c  conditions abbreviated (afk, hunger, thirst, etc)
  %C  conditions as words
  %s  bonus skill exp left today
  %q  daily quests left today

For immortals:
  %r  Sector/building/room number
  %x  immortal conditions abbreviated
  %X  immortal conditions as words

PUT

Usage:  put <item> [in] <container>
        put all.<item> [in] <container>
        put all <container>

carts. Certain vehicles (like ships) also allow you to put items into them
while inside the vehicle yourself -- like a container you can access from any
room.

Examples:

  > put bread in bag
  > put all.bread bag
  > put all chest

See also: GET, KEEP
#
QUIT

When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'. This
will save your character and disconnect you. Only players in the same empire
will see a message that you quit, unless public logins are enabled.

You can use "alt" to quickly change characters, rather than quitting.

You can't quit (or alt) in hostile territory. You can choose to disconnect
instead, but this will leave your character vulnerable.

See also: ALT, CHANGEPASS, SELFDELETE
#
RECOLOR "CUSTOM COLORS"

Usage:  recolor <type> <color code>

You can change the color of many game channels using this command. This can
be helpful if it's difficult for you to see the default colors.

In addition to channels, you can also recolor 'status' which includes cooldowns
and affect-wear-off messages, to make them easier to see in combat.

Type 'recolor' by itself to see your current custom colors.

See HELP COLOR to see a list of color codes.

See also: COLOR
#
REMOVE

Usage:  remove <item>

Like building, repair happens one item at a time using materials in your
inventory or in the room with you.

Fully repairing a vehicle will restore it to full health.

See also: STOP, WORKFORCE
#
REPLY

Usage:  reply <message>

This command will send a reply to the last person to send you a message using
TELL. It works just as if you had typed 'tell <player> <message>' but makes
it a bit easier. It can also be very useful in case someone invisible sends
you a message.

Example:

Ras tells you, 'Hi!'
> reply hey
You tell Ras, 'hey'
>
Someone tells you, 'I am your secret admirer.'
> reply Who are you?
You tell someone, 'Who are you?'

See also: IGNORE, TELL, NOTELL
Immortals see also: BREAKREPLY
#
ROADSIGN "ROAD SIGN" SIGN "BLANK SIGN"

Usage:  roadsign <message>
Materials:  blank sign (stored in the Utility Shed)

If you have the Roads ability and you have specialized in the Empire skill,
you can use blank signs to put up signs on the side of the road. These signs
are made by the Woodworking ability.

The message on the sign can be no longer than 70 characters, and you can only
set up a sign on a road, bridge, swamp walk, or mountain path. If the road is
removed, the sign will be lost. Each road tile can only have one sign at a
time, and using this ability again will replace the old sign.

Gain Roads experience when you place a road sign.

See also: ROADS, WOODWORKING
#
ROLL

Usage:  roll [number of dice] [size of dice]

This command rolls dice for you, to determine random results. It can be used
either in-character or out-of-character. The result will be shown to people in
the room with you, as well as group members.

Examples:
 > roll
 You roll a 100-sided die and get: 57

SAIL DRIVE PILOT SAILING DRIVING PILOTING

Usage:  sail <direction | portal> [distance]
        drive <direction | portal> [distance]
        pilot <direction | portal> [distance]

These three commands are used to control ships, carriages, and other vehicles.
Which command you use depends upon the type of vehicle. Travel in this manner
is usually slow, but does not require movement points. You need to either be
sitting on the vehicle, or inside of it and able to see out, to do this.

Many vehicles cannot move through portals.

If you specify a distance, you will only travel that many tiles. If not, you
will continue to move until you hit an obstacle.

You can use 'stop' to cancel travel at any time. If you don't like seeing the
messages each time the ship moves, you can 'toggle action-spam'.

See also: BOARD, DISEMBARK, DRAG, LAND VEHICLES, LEAD, SHIPBUILDING, SHIPS,
STOP, TOGGLE
#
SAVE

Usage:  save

Save your persona. This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash. The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to save yourself.

This is not the type of game where you can re-load from past saves.
#
SAY OOCSAY OSAY TELL ASK WHISPER ' ""

Usage:  say <string>
        oocsay <string>
        <tell | whisper | ask> <player> <string>

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, and " for oocsay, as in:

  > 'hello there.

#
SAYHISTORY

Usage:  sayhistory

with you. It includes says, emotes, and socials, as well as group messages.

See also: TELLHISTORY
#
SCORE

Usage:  score

The score command provides you all the important information about your
character, including health and attributes.

Your class is determined by your top two skills, and you first receive a class
when both of these skills are past 75. The level shown on score is your total
level, with your skill level shown in parentheses.

Conditions are displayed as:  Health: &g50&0/&g100&0+&g15&0/5s
The first number (50) is your current health, the second (100) is your maximum
health, and the final number (15/5s) is your rate of regeneration. Your
regeneration happens every 5 seconds.

Attributes are rated from 0 to 15. They are shown in green if your current
rating is higher than your base (starting) rating, or red if they are reduced
below your base (by spells or pieces of gear).

You can get more information on most of the traits on the score from their own
help files (e.g. HELP DODGE). The 'Resist' trait is split into two parts: the
first is resist-physical, and the second is resist-magical.

Skills are shown as:  Battle: &g100 (1)&0
In this example, "Battle" is the name of the skill, 100 is your rating in it,
and (1) represents the number of ability points you have to spend.

Score also shows things which are affecting you.

#
SCRAP

Usage:  scrap <vehicle>

This command is used to cancel a partially-built vehicle. No materials will be
refunded.

See also: MANUFACTURE
#
"SCREEN READERS" SCREENREADERS SCREEN-READERS

To turn on/off screen reader mode: toggle screen-reader

A screen reader is an assistive device for players who are blind or visually
impaired. Since EmpireMUD relies so heavily on the ascii map to show what's
going on around you, we have created this mode especially for players who
can't see the map.

The "mapsize" command will determine how far away you can see things. Since
this command is shared with the non-screen-reader view, it is actually the
total diameter of your view and you'll see halfway in each direction. For
example, if your mapsize is 15, you will see up to 7 tiles west and 7 tiles
east.

Available options:
 * toggle informative - If on, tiles will indicate if they are being built
     or dismantled, need repair, and some other status types.
 * toggle political - Indicates who owns different each map tile.
 * toggle brief - This will hide the map display entirely and not show you
     what you can see in each direction.

See also: DISPLAY, SCAN, TOGGLE, MAPSIZE
#

password contains a space, you should put it in "quotes" or (parentheses).

This command cannot be abbreviated.
#
SEPARATE

items.

See also: COMBINE
#
SHARE UNSHARE "SHARED ITEM"

Usage:  share <item>
        unshare

You can "share" any item from your inventory. This allows it to be targeted
by other players' enchantments (and other abilities). This way, another player
can enchant an item that is bound to you. Items in the shared slot don't count
toward your stats your gear level.

To use an ability like "enchant" on another player's shared slot, type the
player's name as the target of the enchantment.

See also: ENCHANT
#
SHEATH SHEATHE

Usage:  sheathe

You can stow up to two weapons from your wield slot, without sending them to
your inventory. Any regular weapon can be sheathed. You do not gain attribute
bonuses from a weapon while it is sheathed.

See also: DRAW, SWAP
#
"SHIP COMMAND" SHIPPING

Usage:  ship status
        ship cancel [number] <item>
        ship <island> [number] <item>

This command allows you to ship stored resources between islands using ships at
your docks. You don't have to be at the docks to queue shipments -- only on
the island you're shipping from. Once you queue items to be shipped, your NPCs
will load up empty ships and move them to the target island. You must have
docks at both ends.

Shipments happen at 7am and 7pm and take up to 4 days (game time; 2 hours
real time) or as little as half a day (15 minutes), depending on distance.

Items will automatically transfer from the empire inventory on the origin
island to the empire inventory on the destination island, and the ship will
appear in one of the docks at the destination.

If the destination island's name contains a space, you must surround it with
double quotes, or use the coordinates of a tile on the island.

You can only ship and cancel shipments from the island you are currently on,
but you can see the status of empire shipments all over the world.

If the 'workforce no-work' option is set on a docks, it won't be used by the
shipping system. You can also set this option on individual ships. (Workforce
is not required to use the shipping system, but 'workforce no-work' is still
used to prevent shipping.)

See also: DISPATCH, DOCKS, EINVENTORY, ISLANDS, SHIPBUILDING, SHIPS, WORKFORCE
#
SLEEP

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your stamina more
quickly. You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while asleep. You
can awaken yourself with the WAKE command.

See also: WAKE
#
SOCIALS

Usage:  <social> [victim]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others. The actor,
victim and bystanders may receive different messages. Generally, social
commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action, but it is
possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on the social. 
(Slap a dragon lately?)

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

  > socials

See also: EMOTE
#
STEALTHABLE

Usage:  toggle stealthable

This toggle prevents you from accidentally performing stealth actions (for
example picking up an item on another empire's territory). It must be enabled
in order to use most PvP stealth commands.

See also: GET, INFILTRATE, PICKPOCKET, STEAL, TOGGLE
#
STOP

Usage:  stop

Stop your current timed action (such as chop, dig, craft).

STRUGGLE

Usage:  struggle

only recourse it to try to struggle free. If you fail, you must wait 30 seconds
to try again, so don't just spam the struggle command over and over.
#
"SUGGESTED ALIASES" "ALIAS SUGGESTIONS"

Here are some suggested aliases. Some of them, like "loot", may involve an
ability you don't have. You can either modify the alias to not have "butcher"
at the end, or you can just ignore the warning message until you get Butcher.
The rest of the loot alias will still work.

Have a useful alias? Submit it with the "idea" command.

Feel free to copy and paste the alias commands below, or modify them as you
like:

alias wake wake;stand;mount;look
alias loot get all corpse;skin corpse;butcher corpse

alias cnw circle nw
alias csw circle sw
alias cse circle se

#
"SUMMON PLAYERS"

Command:  summon player <name>

This command allows you to teleport another player to your location. You can
only summon a player who is grouped with you, and to do so you must be at an
Astral Nexus with another player. That is, you need two players there
(including you) to summon a third player.

Players must accept the summon using 'accept'.

See also: ACCEPT, ASTRAL NEXUS, SUMMON
#
SURVEY

Usage:  survey

This command gets you basic information about the room you're currently in.

See also: ADVENTURE
#
SWAP

Usage:  swap

EmpireMUD uses many different weapon types for activities, and most require
that they be in the wielding position (rather than just held). The swap
command switches the weapons in your hands so that you may quickly change
activities, even with a full inventory.

For an example, consider this: you are alternating between mining and chopping
trees to build more mines. You wield a pick and hold an axe, and "swap" them
as you change back and forth between activities.

See also: DRAW, SHEATH
#
TELLHISTORY

Usage:  tellhistory

Lists the last 20 uses of tells. This is useful if you have clear mode on
and missed something because you were walking.

Example:
 > tellhistory
 Khufu tells you, 'hi!'

See also: SAYHISTORY, TELL
#
THROW

Usage:  throw <object> <direction>

This is used to throw an object into a near-by room. This is used primarily
for burning down buildings.
#
TIE UNTIE

Usage:  tie <target>
        untie <target>

Tie can be used for two basic purposes: to tie up someone you've incapacitated
or to tie an animal so it won't leave.

If you find yourself tied up by a rival, use the struggle command to break
free, and prepare to run.

See also: STRUGGLE, EXECUTE
#
TIME

Usage:  time

Gives you the current game time. Your initial reaction to the output of this
command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it. You'll have to, at
any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this particular notion of

people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

This command is only for wearables, and you should use WIELD, HOLD, SHEATH
and DRAW for the rest.

your weapons and hold slot.

  > wear boots
