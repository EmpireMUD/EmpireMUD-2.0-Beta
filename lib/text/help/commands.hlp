! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard. You can also repeat
any of your last 5 commands by abbreviating the one you want to repeat. For
example, '!w' might repeat your last whois.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string. The syntax
is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"

Examples:

  > tell rasmusen Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.

  > ^rasmusen^rasmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

  > ^you^you doing^
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

+ - -- "INPUT QUEUE" "COMMAND QUEUE" "INPUT LAG" "COMMAND LAG" WAIT QUEUE

The + and - commands allow you to manipulate your input queue. Some commands,
such as abilities, cause a small amount of "command lag". Anything you type
while you have this "lag" is added to the end of your input queue.

You can add a new command to the start of your input queue (instead of the
end of the queue) using a +. For example, "+heal" will put "heal" at the start
of your queue.

You can see your current queue by typing -.

You can clear your entire queue with --, or you can remove specific items with
"-text" where text is an abbreviation for the commands to remove. For example,
"-kick" will remove anything that starts with "kick".
#

#
ALIAS ALIASES

Usage:  alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases. Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias. The alias name must
be one word. The command can be any string. Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively. Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively. The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem kill $1; bash $2
  > killem deer cow

Would attack a deer, followed by bashing a cow. Variables may be used
repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem assist $1; bash $2; bash $2

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

See also: !, ^, SUGGESTED ALIASES
#
ALT ALTERNATE

Usage:  alt <name>
        alt list

This command lets you switch from one alt to another. An "alt" is a character
you own, on your account. You can only use this command to switch between
characters on the same account. No password is required.

Other players will see a log indicating that you switched from one character
to the other, so if you're trying to hide your true identity, you should
probably not use this command.

You can't use alternate again within 60 seconds of a previous use. Please don't
spam players by logging in and out more rapidly than this.

You can't alt (or quit) in hostile territory. You can choose to disconnect
instead, but this will leave your character vulnerable.

You should read the multiplaying/alts rules on the POLICY command for more
information on these rules.

#
ANSI COLOR MAPCOLOR "MAP COLOR" MAP-COLOR

Usage:  toggle color
        toggle map-color

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding of
information, use the COLOR command to turn color on or off.

If you're not on a broadband connection, color may slow down your messages
very slightly. However, even on dialup, it's barely noticeable. If you only
want to shut off map color, the "map-color" toggle will remove color codes
from the world map.

Color codes you can use yourself:
 &0&&0 Normal&0     &u&&u Underline&0

Normal colors:
 &r&&r Red&0        &g&&g Green&0         &y&&y Yellow&0

There are also several possible modifier tags:
 - hard: will require two players in the right level range
 - group: will require three players in the right level range
 - boss: will require four players in the right level range

Unlike older CircleMUDs, EmpireMUD does not require that you be following a
player to group with them, and members don't have to be present for you to
invite them to the group.

There is a limit of 4 members in a group at a time. This is intended to help
balance game encounters against the number of players in the group.

Typing "ignore" with no argument will list who you're ignoring. You can't
choose to ignore an immortal player, and immortals cannot use the ignore

Roads (Empire)
Usage: lay

You may use this ability to lay 20 rocks into the ground to form a cobblestone 
road. Roads eliminate the small movement lag that you normally get while
walking. They can aid in tree and crop control -- nothing will grow over the
roads.

The lay command is also used to pull up a road and retrieve half its rocks.

The Roads ability also allows you to put up road signs, if you specialize in
the Empire skill.

Roads count as their base terrain for most building functions, so you can
build things facing roads, and can usually build right over a road -- but the
road underneath will be lost.

See also: EMPIRE, ROADSIGN
#
LOAD BOATLOAD "BOAT LOAD"

Usage:  load <item> <ship>

This command allows you to load items onto a ship. You can only do this at the

See also: EXAMINE, GET, READ, TAKE
#
MAPSIZE "MAP SIZE"

Usage:  mapsize <size>

This allows you to change the size of your map display to better fit the size
of your screen. Be cautious with large mapsizes because some people are dis-
connected when the game tries to send too much data to their telnet client.

Mapsize is the total width of your map in map tiles (4 characters if you're
using the ascii map; one room if you're using screen-reader mode). The number
is always odd because you sit in the center of it. A mapsize of 3 shows 1 tile
in each direction; a mapsize of 15 (standard) shows 7 in each direction.

#
MAIL CHECK RECEIVE SEND

Usage: mail check

Built on:  plains, desert
Fame:  1
Commands:  portal [destination]
           portal -all
           enter <portal>

You can open a portal between two portal buildings, so long as you have per-
mission to use both buildings. The portal will stay open for a few minutes.
You can target the portal building on the other end using either its co-
ordinates, or the name of a person who is at the other side.

You can portal to specific coordinates by using parentheses (123, 456) or by
typing the coordinates with no space -- 123,456 -- but you can target your
own and allied portals by number.

Typing "portal" with no argument will list portals belonging to your empire
and its allies. Typing "portal -all" will list all public portals belonging
to other empires. You can target empire and ally portals by portal number, but
the -all list can't be targeted this way.

Portals can only connect two locations on the same land mass (continent or
island) unless your empire has a Portal Master. You can't open a portal at all
if there isn't at least a Portal Mage.

Immortals can open portals between any two locations.

See also: FILL, TRENCH
#
PROMPT

Usage: prompt <prompt string>

The prompt is the text you see when the game is waiting for you to do
something, and it's usually right next to where you type (but some mud clients
put typing in its own field). You can use the default prompt, which shows how
injured and tired you are. Or you can choose your own prompt.

Typing "prompt off" will remove your prompt entirely, and "prompt default"
will restore your default prompt.

The base prompt is: &&0|%i/%u>

Here are the prompt codes and what they do:
  %h  Current health      %v  Current moves      %m  Current mana
  %H  Maximum health      %V  Maximum moves      %M  Maximum mana

Usage:  recolor <type> <color code>

You can change the color of many game channels using this command. This can
be helpful if it's difficult for you to see the default colors. However, if a
color is hard for you to see, you should consider lightening it in your client
settings.

In addition to channels, you can also recolor 'status' which includes cooldowns
and affect-wear-off messages, to make them easier to see in combat.

Type 'recolor' by itself to see your current custom colors.

See HELP COLOR to see a list of color codes.

REMOVE

Usage: remove <item>
       remove all
       remove all.<keyword>

If you tire of wearing some armor or wielding a weapon, remove it.

Examples:

  > remove boots
  > remove sword
  > remove all
  > remove all.bronze

#
REPLY

Usage: reply <message>

This command will send a reply to the last person to send you a message using
TELL. It works just as if you had typed 'tell <player> <message>' but makes
it a bit easier. It can also be very useful in case someone invisible sends
you a message.

Example:

Ras tells you, 'Hi!'
> reply hey
You tell Ras, 'hey'
>
Someone tells you, 'I am your secret admirer.'
> reply Who are you?
You tell someone, 'Who are you?'

#
ROADSIGN "ROAD SIGN" SIGN "BLANK SIGN"

Usage:  roadsign <message>
Materials:  blank sign (stored in the Utility Shed)

If you have the Roads ability and you have specialized in the Empire skill,
you can use blank signs to put up signs on the side of the road. These signs
are made by the Woodworking ability.

The message on the sign can be no longer than 70 characters, and you can only
set up a sign on a road, bridge, swamp walk, or mountain path. If the road is
removed, the sign will be lost. Each road tile can only have one sign at a
time, and using this ability again will replace the old sign.

#
ROLL

Usage:  roll [number of dice] [size of dice]

This command rolls dice for you, to determine random results. It can be used
either in-character or out-of-character. The result will be shown to people in
the room with you, as well as group members.

Examples:
 > roll
 You roll a 100-sided die and get: 57
 > roll 6
 You roll a 6-sided die and get: 3
 > roll 2d6
 You roll 2d6 and get: 11
#
SAIL

Usage: sail <direction>

You can sail the ship from any location inside, for your convenience. Ships
can travel on oceans and rivers, through river gates, and under bridges. 
Though this is fairly slow, it is one of the most efficient means of 
transoceanic travel.

#
SAVE

Usage: save

Save your persona. This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash. The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to save yourself.

This is not the type of game where you can re-load from past saves.
#
SAY OOCSAY OSAY TELL ASK WHISPER ' ""

Usage: say <string>
       oocsay <string>
       <tell | whisper | ask> <player> <string>

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, and " for oocsay, as in:

  > 'hello there.

#
SAYHISTORY

Usage:  sayhistory

This command shows you the last 20 messages you saw from players in the room
with you. It includes says, emotes, and socials.

#
SCORE

Usage: score

The score command provides you all the important information about your
character, including health and attributes.

Your class is determined by your top two skills, and you first receive a class
when both of these skills are past 75. The levels shown are your skill level,
your gear level, and your total between the two.

Conditions are displayed as:  Health: &g50&0/&g100&0+&g15&0/hr
The first number (50) is your current health, the 100 is your maximum health,
and the final number (15/hr) is your rate of regeneration. One hour in the MUD
is 75 seconds. Your actual regeneration happens every 5 seconds.

Attributes are rated from 0 to 10. They are shown in green if you have a spell
or piece of gear enhancing the attribute, or red if there is one subtracting
from it.

Dodge: Your bonus to your per cent chance to dodge an attack.
Block: Bonus to chance to block with a shield.
Soak: Damage absorption from gear and spells.
To-hit: Bonus chance to hit with attacks.

Skills are shown as:  Battle: &g100 (1)&0
In this example, "Battle" is the name of the skill, 100 is your rating in it,
and (1) represents the number of ability points you have to spend.

Score also shows things which are affecting you.

#
"SCREEN READERS" SCREENREADERS SCREEN-READERS

To turn on/off screen reader mode: toggle screen-reader

A screen reader is an assistive device for players who are blind or visually
impaired. Since EmpireMUD relies so heavily on the ascii map to show what's
going on around you, we have created this mode especially for players who
can't see the map.

The "mapsize" command will determine how far away you can see things. Since
this command is shared with the non-screen-reader view, it is actually the
total diameter of your view and you'll see halfway in each direction. For
example, if your mapsize is 15, you will see up to 7 tiles west and 7 tiles
east.

Available options:
 * toggle informative - If on, tiles will indicate if they are being built
     or dismantled, need repair, and some other status types.
 * toggle political - Indicates who owns different each map tile.
 * toggle brief - This will hide the map display entirely and not show you
     what you can see in each direction.

#
SCROLLING

Usage:  toggle scrolling

This toggle turns off the page breaks sent when a character receives a long

#
SELFDELETE "SELF DELETE" SELF-DELETE DELETE

Usage:  selfdelete <password> CONFIRM

This command deletes your character, inventory, and all associated files. If
you are the only player in your empire, it may also delete the empire. To use
this command, you must type your password and then the word "CONFIRM". If your
password contains a space, you should put it in "quotes" or (parentheses).

This command cannot be abbreviated.
#
SHEATH SHEATHE

Usage:  sheathe

You can stow up to two weapons from your wield slot, without sending them to
your inventory. Any regular weapon can be sheathed. You do not gain attribute
bonuses from a weapon while it is sheathed.

See also: DRAW, SWAP

SLEEP

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your stamina more
quickly. You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while asleep. You
can awaken yourself with the WAKE command.

See also: WAKE
#
SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [victim]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others. The actor,
victim and bystanders may receive different messages. Generally, social
commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action, but it is
possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on the social. 
(Slap a dragon lately?)

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

  > socials

#
STRUGGLE

to try again, so don't just spam the struggle command over and over.
#
"SUGGESTED ALIASES" "ALIAS SUGGESTIONS"

Here are some suggested aliases. Some of them, like "loot", may involve an
ability you don't have. You can either modify the alias to not have "butcher"
at the end, or you can just ignore the warning message until you get Butcher.
The rest of the loot alias will still work.

Have a useful alias? Submit it with the "idea" command.

Feel free to copy and paste the alias commands below, or modify them as you
like:

alias wake wake;stand;mount;look
alias loot get all corpse;skin corpse;butcher corpse

alias cnw circle nw
alias csw circle sw
alias cse circle se
alias cne circle ne

#
SURVEY

Usage:  survey

This command gets you basic information about the room you're currently in.

See also: ADVENTURE
#
SWAP

Usage: swap

EmpireMUD uses many different weapon types for activities, and most require
that they be in the wielding position (rather than just held). The swap
command switches the weapons in your hands so that you may quickly change
activities, even with a full inventory.

For an example, consider this: you are alternating between mining and chopping
trees to build more mines. You wield a pick and hold an axe, and "swap" them
as you change back and forth between activities.

See also: DRAW, SHEATH
#
TELLHISTORY

Tie can be used for two basic purposes: to tie up someone you've incapacitated
or to tie an animal so it won't leave.

If you find yourself tied up by a rival, use the struggle command to break
free, and prepare to run.

See also: STRUGGLE, EXECUTE
#
TIME

Usage:  time

Gives you the current game time. Your initial reaction to the output of this
command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it. You'll have to, at
any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this particular notion of
time.

Handy time-conversion chart:
 - 1 regeneration tick in-game = 5 seconds
 - 1 hour in-game = 75 seconds
 - 1 day in-game = 30 minutes
 - 1 year in-game = 7 days
#
TITLE

Usage: title <new title>

       wear all

people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

This command is only for wearables, and you should use WIELD, HOLD, SHEATH
and DRAW for the rest.
