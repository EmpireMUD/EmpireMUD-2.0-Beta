OLC .OLC "DOT OLC" "DOT-OLC"

EmpireMUD .olc: An on-line creation system for editing your world.

Usage:  .<type> <command>
        .<command>

The .olc system allows quick, easy in-game editing of objects, mobiles, crafts,
and more. The editor doesn't take you out of the game like some other OLC
systems, so you still have access to help files and public channels.

If you don't like the '.' command, you can also use "olc" instead. If you do,
you must type a space after the command.

Upper immortals can control the olc permissions of builders with the OLC
CONTROLS.

Available types are:
 .b - buildings
 .c - crafts
 .crop - crops
 .m - mobiles
 .o - objects
 .map - map tiles, rooms, and interiors
 .sect - map sectors

Basic commands:
 . - typing '.' by itself shows your current editor
 abort - close your current editor WITHOUT SAVING
 copy <from vnum> <to vnum> - creates a copy of something and opens the editor
 delete <vnum> - deletes a vnum from the database, with all copies of it
 edit <vnum> - loads that vnum into the editor
 list <from vnum> <to vnum> - lists everything in that vnum range
 save - save your open editor and close it

Examples:
 > .o edit 1500
 > olc object edit 1500
 > .m list 50-60

BUILDING "BUILDING GUIDE" "BUILDING PARADIGM" "BUILDING CONTENT" "CONTENT BUILDING"

Content for EmpireMUD is built using the .olc system, which provides editors
for adventures, buildings (and designated rooms), craft (and building) recipes,
crops, mobs, objects, room templates, sectors, and triggers. This document
describes the game's current guidelines for building that content. For help
on the editors instead, see HELP OLC.

** Editor Notes **

Adventures (ADVEDIT):
- When you set a min/max level for the adventure, mobs and items that don't
  have their own level limits will inherit the limits from the adventure.
- If you plan to use obj/room scripts that will do scaled damage, you should
  set one of the LOCK-LEVEL flags on the adventure, otherwise the game might
  not have a good level to use for those scripts. Mob scripts don't require it.
- The !NEARBY flag should only be used on zones where a player shouldn't find
  evidence of them nearby, like a thieves' den.

Buildings (BEDIT):
- Designated rooms are also built in the building editor, using the ROOM flag.
- If a building has at least 1 Citizen, players can also set it as their home.

Crafts (CEDIT):
- Soups are made using the COOK type and the SOUP flag. Instead of choosing an
  item to make, you choose a liquid, and the recipe will require a container
  of water to make the soup in.
- To make a recipe item, build an item ("an old recipe") and set it in a
  craft's requiresobject field. The player will only be able to see and use
  the craft if they have the item in their inventory. You can still also choose
  to require an Ability, for example an armor pattern that requires Armor-
  smithing. You should consider listing the ingredients on the recipe item's
  lookdescription.
- To make an item that can be combined with another item, for example a spear-
  head that can be crafted into a spear, create a craft and set its requires-
  object to the spearhead (just like a recipe item, above). Then, also set the
  spearhead item as a resource to make the craft, too. You'll only be able to
  craft it when the spearhead is in your inventory, but it will consume the
  spearhead when you make it.
- If you use the requiresobject on a BUILD craft, it will always be consumed
  when the building is started. This is different from other types of crafts,
  where the requiresobject is only consumed if it's a "resource" too.
- Scalable objects should not be used as resources or required objects for
  craft recipes. These items aren't stored, so if they're refunded, they will
  scale to their minimum level and lose any modifications.

Crops (CROPEDIT):
- Crop names are always lowercase because they are used to build sentences.
  They should also be plural (e.g. "apples", "rice").
- We don't usually give the crops different seasonal icons, but you can.
- The map region only matters if the crop grows in the wild (no !WILD flag).
- Crops should have a FORAGE interaction for a small single food item.
- Crops should have a HARVEST interaction for a plantable large item.

Globals (GEDIT):
- All global tables must be approved by the head builder, because they apply
  to the entire game rather than just one adventure.
- Only SHEAR and LOOT mob interactions are supported.

Map (MAPEDIT):
- Immortals are not generally permitted to make edits to the map. However,
  small aberrations may be fixed, and it's ok to make tiny (few-tile) edits
  for mortals if there is a good reason (and won't provide any kind of game
  advantage for the player).

Mobs (MEDIT):
- The most significant keyword should always be first. A black bat should put
  "bat" first. Handyman Joe should probably put "Joe" first. The first keyword
  may be used for sentence-building.
- If you don't set a min/max level on the mob, it may inherit them from the
  adventure zone it's in. Otherwise, they may scale to any level at all.
- We usually don't want mobs to be able to scale to any level, so mobs that
  spawn outside of adventure zones should almost alway shave a min/max set.
- Mobs that use the #n tag to pick from a generic name list will be assigned
  a random sex if you leave their sex "neutral".
- The HARD flag means a mob needs two players at its level, or one very good
  player.
- The GROUP flag will require a full group of 4 players at its level, or 3
  players working very hard, or perhaps 2 extremely good players.
- A mob with HARD and GROUP is a major boss fight and may take a lot of work
  even for a full 4-player group.
- ANIMAL mobs will take double damage from players with Hunt.
- Consider using a must-fight script (like a Leave trigger with "return 0")
  rather than the AGGR flag.
- If your mob spawns in a dark adventure, strongly consider giving it INFRA.
- Animal mobs usually need a BUTCHER and SKIN interaction.

Objects (OEDIT):
- The most significant keyword should always be first. A fiery torch should put
  "torch" first. Joe's amazing magical wand should put "wand" first. The first
  keyword may be used to build sentences such as "You attack with your wand."
- Most equipment should be set SCALABLE, and there are very few acceptable
  reasons not to do so. We prefer you rely on the scaling engine rather than
  picking numbers for an object. See HELP ITEM SCALING.
- If you don't set a min/max level on the object, it will inherit the min/max
  from the adventure zone it spawns in. If it spawns outside an adventure zone,
  you should strongly consider a min/max on the object.
- Setting an item to ENCHANTED will make it scale higher, but players will not
  be able to enchant it themselves.
- Most equipment should be set bind-on-equip, included crafted items, so that
  a player can't use them for a while and then re-sell them. Crafters will
  prefer that each player has to buy a new item from, and it will also help to
  encourage players to adventure for their own gear instead of getting hand-me-
  downs from their alts.
- Items from boss fights and most higher-end adventure items should be set
  bind-on-pickup so that players must earn them for themselves. This is a
  "should" rule rather than a "must" rule, but expect the head builder to
  review your use of bind flags and ask you to justify them. You can also use
  bind-on-pickup to encourage players to do adventures for themselves, even at
  low levels.
- Only reasonably small or simple weapons should have the HOLD wear flag (in
  addition to WIELD). We don't let players wield two huge axes.
- Even if a weapon normally takes two hands to wield, don't set the TWO-
  HANDED flag unless you want it to be a big big weapon. This flag requires an
  ability that is only available at level 100, to certain classes.
- Storage is only used for resources and common items. Scalable and enchanted
  items will never be storable in normal storage. You don't have to set any
  storage locations for an item to be stored in "warehouse storage".
- If an item is used as a building resource, you should give it custom messages
  for build-to-char and build-to-room.
- All lights must have a timer. If you want a player to activate a light before
  it starts timing down, make an unlit version with a LIGHT interaction.

Room Templates (REDIT):
- Don't confuse room templates with the designated rooms that players can add
  to their buildings; those are made in the building editor. Room templates are
  only for adventure zones.
- If your rooms are DARK (or OUTDOOR but not LIGHT), you should consider giving
  your mobs INFRA.
- You can use "random" direction exits to make an adventure's layout change
  from instance to instance.
- If your adventure is set on a ship, you can use the port/starboard/fore/aft
  directions. Actually, you can use them even if it's not, but that might be
  silly.
- If you use the ROTATABLE flag on your adventure itself, the directions of
  your exits can be rotated so the zone has the same shape, but a different
  orientation in each instance. Random exits aren't really affected by this.
  Ship directions like "starboard" are also not affected by this, as starboard
  is the same direction no matter which way a ship faces.

Sectors (SECTEDIT):
- The IS-ADVENTURE, MAP-BUILDING, and INSIDE-ROOM flags are for very specific
  special use, and shouldn't be used on new sectors. However, they won't really
  do anything.
- Please provide a useful list of commands for any new sector. For example, if
  you add any DIG interaction, put "dig" on the commands list.

Triggers and Scripts (TRIGEDIT):
- Scripts must be formatted with /f -- this will also ensure your if/end and
  while/done tags all match.
- Each time you change a script's "types", it will reset its percent or other
  type-specific fields. Those fields also won't appear until types are set.
- If your script is confusing, please add comments to it (using *).
- If a mob or room trigger uses scaled commands like %damage% or %aoe%, you
  should ensure that it's used in an adventure zone with a LOCK-LEVEL flag,
  otherwise the game may not be able to determine a scaled level. Objects that
  were dropped as loot by mobs should also already have scaled levels. Mob
  scripts also almost always have a valid scaled level, even if if not in a
  level-locked adventure zone.
- Adventure zone scripts that use %goto% (or any room-targeting commands) must
  use room targets like i1234 to target by room template vnum instead of live
  room vnum. This will cause it to go to the current instance's version of a
  room template. It only works for room templates in the same adventure zone.
- If a script loads an object or mob, and it's not in a level-locked adventure
  zone, the script may also need to scale the obj's/mob's level itself.
#d
"OLC LEVELS" "OLC SCALING" "OLC SCALE"

There are several ways you can set levels for things, and level will cascade
from Adventure to Mob to Object.

When the game scales an object, it checks the level limits on the object itself
first. If either the min or max are 0, they will inherit the min or max from
the adventure they are in.

An object is scaled to the level of the mob who dropped it as loot, or who
loaded it, so the object's level may also be limited by the mob's level if the
object doesn't have its own level limits. Remember that mobs aren't usually
scaled until combat begins, but they can be pre-scaled by the adventure flags
LOCK-LEVEL-ON-ENTER or LOCK-LEVEL-ON-COMBAT if you need the mob scaled without
combat.

When a mob scales, it also first checks its own min/max scale levels, and if
it doesn't have its own min or max, it will inherit one from the adventure it
is in.

#d
"ADVEDIT AUTHOR"

Usage:  .author <name>

This allows you to set the name of the author of the zone, which is used to
give credit to the original builder.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

The adventure description is shown to players who request information about the
adventure.

The description is set in the string editor. You should use /fi to format it
with indent inside the string editor.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, STRING EDITOR
#d
"ADVEDIT ENDVNUM" "ADVEDIT END VNUM" "ADVEDIT STARTVNUM" "ADVEDIT START VNUM"

Usage:  .startvnum <vnum>
        .endvnum <vnum>

The vnum range determines which room templates are loaded when the instance is
instantiated. All rooms in the adventure must fall within this vnum range.

Only high-level immortals can edit the vnums of an adventure. Lower-level imms
may edit other properties of their own adventures.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT FLAGS" "ADVENTURE FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following adventure flags are available:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - The adventure will not be instantiated in the world.
 LOCK-LEVEL-ON-ENTER - Instance level locks when a player enters.
 LOCK-LEVEL-ON-COMBAT - Instance level locks when a player fights.
 !NEARBY - Instances do not show up when players type nearby.
 ROTATABLE - Each instance will have a random orientation (whole zone rotates).
 CONFUSING-RANDOMS - The instancer will not logically match random exits.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, OLC REMOVEINDEV
#d
"ADVEDIT LIMIT" "INSTANCE LIMIT"

Usage:  .limit <number>

This number controls how many copies of an adventure can exist in the world
at a time.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINK BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINKING BDG-EXISTING"

Usage:  .linking add BDG-EXISTING <building vnum> <dir> [flags]

This adds an exit, in the direction of your choice (or "random"), to an exist-
ing building in the world. If you don't set the CLAIMED-OK flag, it will only
target unclaimed buildings, which may be rarer depending on player behavior.

CAUTION: this will NOT work well with "open"-style buildings, such as
fountains, because they can't have normal exits. If you want to connect an
adventure to an open building, use PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING instead.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINK BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINKING BDG-NEW"

Usage:  .linking add BDG-NEW <building vnum> <dir> "<build on>" ["build facing"] [flags]

This will construct a new building somewhere in the world. The direction you
specify will be the direction of the exit from the building into the adventure
zone. The building may face a random direction.

You must specify flags for what type of terrain it can be built upon. In most
cases, you must also specify the type(s) of terrain it must be built facing.
Both of these are the same as the "buildon" and "buildfacing" flags from the
craft and sector editors; see &yHELP SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS&0.

CAUTION: this will NOT work well with "open"-style buildings, such as
fountains, because they can't have normal exits. If you want to connect an
adventure to an open building, use PORTAL-BDG-NEW instead.

CAUTION: You must not use designated rooms (or any "building" with the ROOM
flag) for this, because they can't be built on the map.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT NOT-NEAR-SELF" "ADVEDIT LINK NOT-NEAR-SELF" "ADVEDIT LINKING NOT-NEAR-SELF"

Usage:  .linking add NOT-NEAR-SELF <distance>

This linking rule limits all other rules based on distance. You can use it to
keep the same adventure from spawning two copies in close proximity.

All distances are measured in map tiles. Setting a NOT-NEAR-SELF of 50 would
mean no two copies of the adventure will link within 50 tiles of each other.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING
#d
"ADVEDIT PORTAL-WORLD" "ADVEDIT LINK PORTAL-WORLD" "ADVEDIT LINKING PORTAL-WORLD"

Usage:  .linking add PORTAL-WORLD <sector vnum> <portal-in vnum> <portal-out vnum> [flags]

This will spawn a portal somewhere in the world, matching the sector of your
choice. You must provide portal object vnums for the in- and out-portals, but
it is okay if both are the same.

Remember that the portals don't have to be called portals. You could use "a
strange door in the side of the tree", and the messages would look correct
when players type "enter door" or "enter tree".

CAUTION: if you choose a sector like "Building", the portal will be able to
spawn in any building. You should NEVER use the "Adventure Room" sector, as
spawning an adventure inside of random adventures will have strange side-
effects, such as trapping players in the 2nd adventure.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINK PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINKING PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING"

Usage:  .linking add PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING <building vnum> <portal-in vnum> <portal-out vnum> [flags]

This will spawn a portal in a random building (or designated room) matching the
vnum you set here. You must provide portal object vnums for the in- and out-
portals, but it is okay if both are the same.

Remember that the portals don't have to be called portals. You could use "a
trapdoor in the floor", and the messages would look correct when players type
"enter trapdoor".

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT PORTAL-BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINK PORTAL-BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINKING PORTAL-BDG-NEW"

Usage:  .linking add PORTAL-BDG-NEW <building vnum> <portal-in vnum> <portal-out vnum> "<build on>" "[build facing]" [flags]

This will first create a building on the map, and then spawn a portal inside
it. You must provide portal object vnums for the in- and out-portals, but it
is okay if both are the same.

You must specify flags for what type of terrain it can be built upon. In most
cases, you must also specify the type(s) of terrain it must be built facing.
Both of these are the same as the "buildon" and "buildfacing" flags from the
craft and sector editors; see &yHELP SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS&0.

Remember that the portals don't have to be called portals. You could use "a
trapdoor in the floor", and the messages would look correct when players type
"enter trapdoor".

CAUTION: You must not use designated rooms (or any "building" with the ROOM
flag) for this, because they can't be built on the map.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT TIME-LIMIT" "ADVEDIT LINK TIME-LIMIT" "ADVEDIT LINKING TIME-LIMIT"

Usage:  .linking add TIME-LIMIT <minutes> [flags]

This linking option allows you to force the adventure to de-spawn after a
certain amount of time. You can also despawn an adventure early using the
%adventurecomplete% command in a script.

Adventures will never de-spawn while players are still inside.

Adventures should ALMOST ALWAYS have this option set. If they can spawn on
claimed land, it is required, in order to ensure the adventure eventually
de-spawns.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, %ADVENTURECOMPLETE%
#d
"ADVEDIT LINKING" "ADVEDIT LINK RULE" "LINKING RULES" "LINK RULES"

Linking rules help the game engine determine where to link instances of an
adventure. You can add as many linking rules as you like; it will spawn
instances in any place that matches any rule.

See specific help files for each type: &yHELP ADVEDIT <TYPE>&0
 BDG-EXISTING: Link from an existing building or interior room.
 BDG-NEW: Builds the building on the map and links from it (no interior rooms).
 PORTAL-WORLD: Portal appears in a matching sector.
 PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING: Portal appears in an existing building or interior room.
 PORTAL-BDG-NEW: Builds the building on the map and puts a portal in it (no
    interior rooms).
 TIME-LIMIT: Removes instances after a certain number of minutes expire.
 NOT-NEAR-SELF: Prevent the adventure from linking near other copies of itself.

Available flags:
 CLAIMED-OK - Can link to claimed locations (default: unclaimed only).
 CITY-ONLY - Only links to claimed tiles in cities.
 !CITY - Will not link to claimed tiles in cities.

Portals require a portal object for both the entrance and exit (they may be
the same object). Existing buildings may also be interior rooms, but new
building rules require a normal map building (one without the ROOM flag).

For types requiring build-on or build-facing, you should include the set of
build flags in quotes ("plains forest") if you use more than one. For the full
list of build flags, see HELP SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT MAXLEVEL" "ADVEDIT MAX LEVEL" "ADVEDIT MINLEVEL" "ADVEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <number>
        .minlevel <number>

These settings control the minimum and maximum levels for an adventure zone.
These are set in terms of players' composite level (the level number given by
their skills and gear).

The OLC LEVELS help file has additional notes on how to choose levels.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, OLC LEVELS
#d
"ADVEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This lets you set the name of the adventure. The names should be reasonably
short (less than 1 line) and concise. Usually, these are written in title case
(the first letter of each word is uppercase).

Example names:
 > Magiterranean: The Grove
 > Ruins: Bandit Camp

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT PLAYERLIMIT" "ADVEDIT PLAYER LIMIT"

Usage:  .playerlimit <number>

This allows you to restrict the number of players who may be inside an
adventure at one time.

Setting it to 0 means no-limit. The maximum group size is 4, so that is a safe
limit on most adventures.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT RESET" "ADVEDIT RESET TIME" "ADVEDIT RESETTIME"

Usage:  .reset <minutes>

This sets the time between adventure zone resets. Each time the zone resets,
it may spawn more mobs and objects.

You may set a reset time of 0 if the adventure should never reset once it has
been instantiated.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"AFFECT FLAGS"

The following affect flags are available:
 BLIND - Unable to see.
 MAJESTY - Hard to attack.
 INFRA - Can see in the dark (glowing red eyes).
 SNEAK - Cannot be seen while moving.
 HIDE - Cannot be seen in room (without search).
 CHARM - NPC will take orders from its master -- do not use this on items.
 INVIS - Can't be seen, except by magic.
 !BATTLE - Immune to the Battle debuffs.
 SENSE-HIDE - Can see hidden people.

 !STUN - Immune to stun effects.
#d
"BEDIT AFFECTS" "REDIT AFFECTS"

Usage:  .affects [add | remove] <flags>

Each building (or room template) type may have a default set of room affect
flags. These are added to the building tile when built, or are present on a
room that is instantiated from a room template.

Available affects (do not set affects with *):
 DARK - magically dark and the map tile shows as blank
 SILENT - magically quiet
 CHAMELEON - at distance, appears as the tile it was built upon
 !EVOLVE - will not grow trees or process other evolutions
 !FLY - flying characters cannot enter, like an enchanted wall
 !DISREPAIR - never falls into disrepair (caution: this prevents empire decay)

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, OLC ROOM TEMPLATES
#d
"BEDIT ARTISAN"

Usage:  .artisan <mob vnum>
        .artisan none

Some buildings may have artisan mobs set. These mobs will always spawn in the
building if the building is owned by an empire and has been populated. Only
one artisan will ever spawn per building.

This artisan is marked as an EMPIRE mob and you may use the following name
tokens on the mob itself, if it is only loaded as an artisan:
 #n - randomly chosen first name
 #e - name of the empire it belongs to
 #a - the adjective form of its empire's name

You can use the "none" argument to this command in order to remove the artisan.

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, MEDIT NAMESET, VNUM
#d
"BEDIT CITIZENS"

Usage:  .citizens <number>

This sets how many citizens will move into the base room of the building. It
does not affect any designated/extra rooms. Once populated, these citizens
spawn in the building tile when players are nearby. They can also perform
Workforce chores near their home building.

You cannot control which citizen mobs actually spawn, only how many may live
here total. If the building supports extra rooms, more citizens can be added
in bedrooms.

NOTE: Any building that allows at least 1 citizen may also be set as a player's
private home.

See also: BEDIT EXTRA ROOMS, HOME, OLC BUILDINGS, WORKFORCE
#d
"BEDIT COMMANDS"

Usage:  .commands <list>
        .commands none

Buildings that allow specific commands should list those commands to help
players. If you set a commands list, it will appear below the room description
(for closed buildings) or below the map (for open buildings).

If this is a storage building, you should always include inventory, retrieve,
and store. If you set the DRINK flag, you should add drink and fill. Consider
all the special tasks a player might perform here.

We generally keep the commands list in alphabetic order with commas between
the commands, and do not put the word "and" before the last entry.

Example:
 > .commands chop, dig, gather, pick

See also: BEDIT FLAGS, OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

All buildings need a good description (except ones flagged OPEN). The
description should be at least 3 full lines, and should always be formatted
with the /fi option in the string editor. Generally descriptions should not
run more than about 6 lines.

The room description is shown when the building is complete (or, it is always
shown if the building is flagged CLOSED). 

See also: BEDIT FLAGS, OLC BUILDINGS, STRING EDITOR
#d
"BEDIT DESIGNATE"

Usage:  .designate [add | remove] <flags>

Designate flags control what types of rooms may be added to a building. This
only matters if the "extra rooms" property is set greater than 0.

Rooms can be designated in buildings that have a matching designate flag with
the room. Rooms with no designate flags can't be designated at all (these may
be used for other internal functions).

Available designate flags:
 CRYPT - can designate the crypt
 VAULT - may designate a vault
 FORGE - may designate a forge
 TUNNEL - may designate the tunnel room (for underground/mountain houses)
 HALL - may designate hallways
 SKYBRIDGE - may designate the skybridge room (for treehouses)
 THRONE - may designate a throne room
 ARMORY - not currently used
 GREAT-HALL - may designate great halls (for castles)
 BATHS - may designate bath rooms
 LABORATORY - may designate laboratories (for alchemy)
 TOP-OF-TOWER - may designate the top-of-the-tower room (for the sorcery tower)
 HOUSEHOLD - may designate bedroom, study, sitting room, closet, storage, etc
 HAVEN - vampire havens

See also: OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT FAME"

Usage:  .fame <amount>

This number is added to an empire's fame for each instance of this building
they own.

You can set negative fame to penalize empires for certain buildings.

Most buildings should have 0 fame, unless they are monuments.

#d
"BEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

When set on a building, these flags affect all interior rooms, too. When set
on a designate-able room (a building where the ROOM flag is set), they only
affect players in that room.

Available flags:
 ROOM - this is a room that can be added with the designate command if it has
    matching designate flags with a building
 ALLOW-MOUNTS - players can ride inside without dismounting
 TWO-ENTRANCES - the building will have a rear entrance across from the main
    entrance (does not apply to OPEN buildings)
 OPEN - never takes the player off the map, shows no room description, and
    cannot have interior rooms
 CLOSED - always shows the room description and takes the player off the map,
    even if the building is not complete
 INTERLINK - can be interlinked with other nearby INTERLINK buildings
 HERD - mobs can be herded into this building
 DEDICATE - can be dedicated to a patron god or player, which adds "of Name"
    to the room title

 TAVERN - functions as a tavern (don't set this on the same building as DRINK)
 COUNTS-AS-CITY - always counts as in-city territory
 MINE - can be mined for ore resources
 ATTACH-ROAD - on the ascii map, roads attach to this tile like it's a road
 BURNABLE - will catch fire if a fire is placed inside by a hostile empire
 FORGE - can use the forge and reforge commands here
 COOKING-FIRE - can cook, brew, and other tasks that require a fire
 ALCHEMIST - can brew and mix here
 STABLE - can shear, milk, and barde animals here; animals in this building don't despawn
 LIBRARY - can write and store books here
 APIARY - grants the Apiaries tech to the empire
 GLASSBLOWER - grants the Glassblowing tech to the empire
 DOCKS - grants the seaport tech to the empire; counts as a dock for ships

 POTTER - pottery craft time is reduced here
 TAILOR - counts as tailor; can use refashion here
 BATHS - can use the bathe command here
 SAIL - can enter this building with a boat
 TOMB - players can re-spawn here after dying
 MINT-COINS - functions as a mint
 VAULT - stores coins, can use the warehouse command for privileged storage
 ITEM-LIMIT - only a certain number of items can be dropped here
 LONG-AUTOSTORE - autostore takes 72 hours instead of 3 here
 WAREHOUSE - can use the warehouse command and store unique items
 TRADE - access to global trade, e.g. a trading post
 HIGH-DEPLETION - has more resources than a normal tile
 PORTAL - functions as a portal building
 BEDROOM - boosts regen while sleeping
 !DELETE - will not be deleted for not having a homeroom
 SUMMON-PLAYERS - allows the summon player command

* Note: If you change the COUNTS-AS-CITY flag on existing buildings, territory
        counts will not update right away. Any empire can force a re-count
        by claiming or abandoning any tile.

#d
"BEDIT HITPOINTS"

Usage:  .hitpoints <value>

This number is how much damage a building can take from a catapult or siege
ritual before it is destroyed.

Catapults deal 8 damage per shot. Siege rituals deal Intelligence + 1 damage.

See also: CATAPULT, OLC BUILDINGS, SIEGE RITUAL
#d
"BEDIT ICON"

Usage:  .icon <icon>

The icon is how a building appears on the world map. It must always be exactly
4 characters long, not counting any color codes.

Buildings usually use icons like: [  ], (  ), {  }
Usually the symbols inside the parentheses or braces are a pair of letters that
loosely indicate what building it is, but you should try not to duplicate
existing buildings.

If you don't start with a color code, the building will have a color based on
the tile it was built upon (and the season). In addition to normal color codes, 
you can use &&? to represent the base tile's color if you need to use it later
in the color code. If you want to use the && symbol in the icon, you must
double it (&&&&).

There is no need to put a &&0 at the end of the icon.

See additional info at HELP SPECIAL ICONS.

Examples:
 > .icon &&0[--]
 > .icon .&&0[]&&?.

See also: COLOR, OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT MILITARY"

Usage:  .military <number>

This property adds to the military total of the empire that owns it. However,
the military value of an empire is not used for anything at the moment.

See also:  OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The 'name' property is used by some commands like 'territory' and 'vnum' to
search for buildings, so it should be reasonably unique. It's also shown as
the short form of a building in some sentences.

You should choose a name that's as short as possible. For example, if your
room title is "A Foul-Smelling Outhouse", the name should be "Outhouse".

See also: BEDIT TITLE, OLC BUILDINGS, TERRITORY, VNUM
#d
"BEDIT ROOMS" "BEDIT ROOMS"

Usage:  .rooms <number>

If this number is greater than 0, players may use the 'designate' command to
add additional rooms to the building, with options based on what you set with
the '.designate' olc option.

NOTE: If players add bedrooms to a building, it will spawn additional citizens.

See also: BEDIT DESIGNATE, OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT SPAWNS" "CROPEDIT SPAWNS" "SECTEDIT SPAWNS"

Usage:  .spawns add <mob vnum> <percent> [flags]
        .spawns copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .spawns remove <number | all>
        .spawns list

This lets you control how mobs spawn in a given location. Mobs only spawn if
there aren't too many other mobs present, and only if they meet the percent
and flag requirements of their spawn info.

You can set any percent between .01 and 100. This is the chance the mob will
be loaded each time the room is checked for spawns, which is usually every few
minutes while players are nearby. Any mob spawned this way will gain the
SPAWNED mob flag and will despawn if no players are nearby.

Setting two flags which are mutually exclusive (e.g. NORTHERN and SOUTHERN)
will result in the mob never spawning. The flags indicate the mob will spawn
ONLY if the condition is met.

Available spawn flags:
 NOCTURNAL - only spawns at night
 DIURNAL - only spawns during the day
 CLAIMED - only spawns if the room/tile is claimed
 UNCLAIMED - only spawns if the room/tile is NOT claimed
 CITY - only spawns if the tile is in-city (and claimed)
 OUT-OF-CITY - only spawns if the tile is not in a city, or is unclaimed
 NORTHERN - only spawns in the northern half of the map
 SOUTHERN - only spawns in the southern half of the map
 EASTERN - only spawns in the eastern half of the map
 WESTERN - only spawns in the western half of the map

Example:
 > .spawns add 12499 3 NOCTURNAL UNCLAIMED

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, OLC CROPS, OLC SECTORS, VNUM
#d
"BEDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

This sets the room title for the building. It is shown above the room
description or map. The room's title will be colored based on the empire that
owns it, so it's important not to put color codes in the title.

Room titles are usually short, descriptive phrases, with title-case lettering
(Title Case Capitalizes Most Words). They should usually start with "A", "An",
or "The".

Examples:
 The Greatest Building You Never Heard Of
 A Strange House
 The Eye of the World

See also: OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT UGPRADESTO" "BEDIT UPGRADES TO"

Usage:  .upgradesto <building vnum>
        .upgradesto none

Some buildings can be upgraded into other buildings. You specify which building
this one can upgrade to here. You must specify a valid building vnum.

In order for the 'upgrade' command to actually work, you must also use the
craft recipe editor to create a new building recipe for the upgraded building,
and mark it as UPGRADE. This building will only need a regular craft recipe,
and only if it's buildable.

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, UPGRADE, VNUM	
#d
"CEDIT ABILITY"

Usage:  .ability <ability name | none>

You can use this command to set which ability is required to use a particular
craft recipe. If you don't want it to require an ability any more, use 'none'.

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT BUILDFACING" "CEDIT BUILD FACING"

Usage:  .buildfacing [add | remove] <flags>
        .buildfacing generic

This command sets the rules for the tile a building must face. If the building
is an "open" building (one that doesn't take players off the map), it doesn't
require a buildfacing at all. However, if an "open" building has a buildfacing,
the game engine will still require a facing direction when it is built. This
allows you to require that quarries are built next to mountains, for example.

You can also set ".buildfacing generic", which sets a pre-defined list of
buildfacing flags that many buildings are allowed to face.

The following flags are available:
 water - any ocean or river tile
 plains - a plains or a road that was built on plains
 mountain - a mountain or mountain path
 forest - an overgrown forest (^^^^)
 desert - a desert or a road that was built on desert
 river - a river tile
 jungle - any jungle tile
 * - UNUSED
 ocean - an ocean tile
 oasis - an oasis tile
 crops - any crop or seeded tile
 grove - a desert grove tile
 swamp - a swamp tile
 any forest - any level of forest tile, from light forest to overgrown
 open building - a building that doesn't block the map

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT BUILDING"

Usage:  .building <type>

This lets you set the actual building or other construction type that the
recipe will build. The list varies depending on the .buildtype you chose.

See also: CEDIT BUILDTYPE, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT BUILDON" "CEDIT BUILD ON"

Usage:  .buildon [add | remove] <flags>

This sets the types of terrain that a building craft may be built upon. You
must set at least one flag.

The following flags are available:
 water - any ocean or river tile
 plains - a plains or a road that was built on plains
 mountain - a mountain or mountain path
 forest - an overgrown forest (^^^^)
 desert - a desert or a road that was built on desert
 river - a river tile
 jungle - any jungle tile
 * - UNUSED
 ocean - an ocean tile
 oasis - an oasis tile
 crops - *** do not use for buildon
 grove - a desert grove tile
 swamp - a swamp tile
 any forest - *** do not use for buildon
 open building - *** do not use for buildon

See also: CEDIT BUILDFACING, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT BUILDTYPE" "CEDIT BUILD TYPE"

Usage:  .buildtype <type>

Building craft recipes can be one of three types, and these types will
determine which .building set you can choose from.

Available buildtypes:
 BUILDING - a normal building
 ROAD - a road, bridge, mountain path, etc.
 BARRIER - a fence or wall

See also: CEDIT BUILDING, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT CREATES"

Usage:  .creates <object vnum>

This options sets which object is created by the recipe. This only applies to
recipes which are not soup.

See also: CEDIT QUANTITY, OLC CRAFTS, VNUM
#d
"CEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Flags let you specify certain properties about the craft recipe, like where it
must be performed.

You must leave the IN-DEVELOPMENT flag set until the recipe is ready to go
live, at which point it becomes available to players who have the right skill.

Available flags:
 POTTERY - always requires cooking fire, goes faster at potter's hut
 APIARIES-TECH - requires being inside an empire with Apiaries tech
 GLASS-TECH - requires being inside an empire with Glassblowing tech
 GLASSBLOWER - requires being at an actual glassblower building
 CARPENTER - requires being at a carpenter building
 ALCHEMY - requires cooking fire and glassblowing tech, or alchemist/laboratory
 SHARP-TOOL - requires a sharp tool in the wield slot
 FIRE - requires cooking fire
 SOUP - requires a container of water and creates a liquid instead of an item
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - only immortals can use this recipe
 UPGRADE - for building recipes only, marks this recipe as the cost to upgrade
    to this building type from some other type
 DISMANTLE-ONLY - for building recipes only, this recipe allows the building
    to be dismantled, but not built; it won't show up in the build list
 IN-CITY-ONLY - a craft or building can only be made in a city radius

See also: CEDIT TYPE, OLC CRAFTS, OLC REMOVEINDEV
#d
"CEDIT LEVELREQUIRED" "CEDIT LEVEL REQUIRED"

Usage:  .levelrequired <level>

This lets you set the crafting level required to make a craft. It works on any
type of craft. This uses the 'Crafting' trait shown on score, and the +CRAFTING
apply from items. Crafting level includes skill level, so a requirement of 100
would only require that the player be skill level 100.

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT LIQUID"

Usage:  .liquid <type>

For soups, the recipe requires a drink container of water and fills that with
a liquid type, rather than creating a new object. This command determines the
liquid type.

See also: CEDIT FLAGS, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This sets the name of the craft recipe. The name used when the player chooses
which recipe to craft, e.g. "craft hammock".

Names should be as short as possible, while still being distinct from other
existing craft recipes.

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT QUANTITY"

Usage:  .quantity <number>

Craft recipes can be set to create more than one of an item by raising the
quantity.

See also: CEDIT CREATES, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT REQUIRESOBJECT" "CEDIT REQUIRES OBJECT"

Usage:  .requiresobject <vnum>

Some craft recipes may require a specific object. If the user doesn't have
the object, the recipe won't show up in the list at all. This essentially
associates the recipe to the object.

Pro tip: Combine requiresobject with no-ability to create a building like a
tent, which can be built as long as you have one in your inventory.

For non-building crafts, the object is not consumed unless it's also on the
list of required resources.

Don't use SCALABLE items as a required object if it will be consumed, because
it won't be scaled back to the same level if it's refunded.

See also: OLC CRAFTS, VNUM
#d
"CEDIT RESOURCE"

Usage:  .resource add <amount> <vnum>
        .resource change <number> <quantity | vnum> <value>
        .resource remove <number | all>
        .resource move <number> <up | down>

This command sets the resources required to make the recipe.

Building recipes will require the resources in the order given here; crafting
recipes will use all resources at once. Dismantled buildings also return half
of the used resources, rounded down.

Don't use SCALABLE items as a resource, because it won't be scaled back to
the same level if it's refunded.

See also: OLC CRAFTS, VNUM
#d
"CEDIT TIME"

Usage:  .time <ticks>

This sets the time (in action ticks) that it takes to create the recipe. One
action tick is 5 real seconds. In some cases, the time is reduced by meeting
certain requirements.

For crafts with the POTTERY flag, they take 1/4 the time if crafted at a
potter's hut.

All crafting times are cut in half for players with the matching mastery
ability.

All crafting times are cut in half if they require a hammer or sharp tool,
and that tool is marked (superior).

See also: CEDIT FLAGS, CEDIT MASTERY, CEDIT TYPE, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT TYPE"

Usage:  .type <type>

The type determines which command is used to craft the item, but not which
ability. Some types also have built-in rules.

Available types are:
 FORGE - requires a hammer and a forge building
 CRAFT
 COOK
 SEW
 MILL - requires mill building, quantity doubled by Master Farmer ability
 BREW - potions
 MIX - poisons

See also: CEDIT ABILITY, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT VOLUME"

Usage:  .volume <drinks>

For soups, this determines the maximum number of drinks created by the recipe.
It will always be limited by the size of the drink container the player uses
to cook the soup in.

See also: CEDIT FLAGS, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CROPEDIT CLIMATE" "SECTEDIT CLIMATE"

Usage:  .climate <type>

Each crop and sector has a climate, and these must match for the crop to be
planted on the sector. Climate also affects certain abilities, such as morphs.
Terrains like generic rivers and mountains may have no climate at all. However,
every crop must be associated with a climate.

See also: OLC CROPS, OLC SECTORS
#d
"CROPEDIT FLAGS" "CROP FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Crop flags determine some various properties about crops.

Available flags:
 REQUIRES-WATER - Can only be planted within 4 tiles of fresh water
 ORCHARD - Uses 'pick' instead of 'harvest', shows the orchard commands list, can be chopped down

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"CROPEDIT MAPOUT COLOR" "SECTEDIT MAPOUT COLOR" "MAPOUT COLOR" "MAP OUT COLOR"

Usage:  .mapout <color>

This determines what color pixel the sector or crop has on the graphical map.

See also: OLC CROPS, OLC SECTORS
#d
"CROPEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

A crop's name is a short name, always plural and lower-case, that describes
the crop. It is frequently used to build sentences such as "You start planting
<name> here."

The editor will force the first character of the name to be lower-case.

Examples:
 "apples"
 "olives"
 "gourds"

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"CROPEDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

This is the room title for rooms of this crop type. As with all room titles,
it should be title-cased (Each Word Capitalized), should usually start with
an article like "a" or "an", and should not include any punctuation.

Examples:
 "An Apple Orchard"
 "A Field of Cotton"
 "A Vast Cornfield"

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"CROPEDIT XMIN" "CROPEDIT XMAX" "CROPEDIT YMIN" "CROPEDIT YMAX"

Usage:  .xmin <percent>
        .xmax <percent>
        .ymin <percent>
        .ymax <percent>

These four settings help the MUD determine where a crop can spawn. It spawns
if its x-coordinate is <= xmax or >= xmin, and y-coordinate is <= ymax or >=
ymin.

If the 'min' is less than the 'max', this specifies the area between the two.
If the 'max' is less than the 'min', it instead covers both edges of the map,
but NOT the area between the two.

These numbers range from 0-100 because they are percentages of the current map
width, not absolute values.

You should always make sure you have crops set to cover all parts of the map,
so that the crop-spawning systems can pick a valid crop for any region. It
usually helps to draw yourself a diagram on paper of the regions of the map
covered by the crops.

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"GEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

This set of flags applies to the global table itself.

Available flags:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - Will not be used live.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MAXLEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This sets the upper limit of the level range for this global table.

For example, a 'Mob Interactions' global table will only be used if the mob
is scaled to this maxlevel or lower.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MINLEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This sets the lower limit of the level range for this global table.

For example, a 'Mob Interactions' global table will only be used if the mob
is scaled to this minlevel or higher.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MOBEXCLUDE"

Usage:  .mobexclude [add | remove] <flags>

A 'Mob Interactions' global table may have mob flags set to exclude. If so, the
global table is only used if a mob DOES NOT have all the flags in this set.
For example, you can use it to create a set that does not apply to HARD mobs.

These are the same set of flags from HELP MEDIT FLAGS.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MOBFLAGS"

Usage:  .mobflags [add | remove] <flags>

A 'Mob Interactions' global table may have mob flags set. If so, the global
table is only used if a mob has ALL of the flags set here. For example, you
might set a global table to only apply to HARD mobs.

These are the same set of flags from HELP MEDIT FLAGS.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This lets you set the 'name' property of a global table. Names are only shown
to the immortal staff, never to players. The name should indicate what this
table is for.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT TYPE"

Usage:  .type <type>

This is the type of global table. Different types are used for different
things. Each type may have its own properties.

Types:
 Mob Interactions - Used for global SHEAR and LOOT tables.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"ITEM SCALING" "OBJ SCALING" "OBJECT SCALING" SCALABLE "SCALABLE FLAG" "SCALING ITEM"

Items can be set to scale to different levels. You can set various traits on
the item, and their relative strengths, but the actual strength levels are set
by the game engine.

To make a scalable item, set:
 - the SCALABLE flag
 - the minlevel property (optional)
 - the maxlevel property (optional)
 - the SUPERIOR, ENCHANTED, or JUNK flags (optional, each changes the scaling)
 - values and applies (see below)

When you set applies, instead of setting the level you want them at, set a
number that indicates relative power. For example, if you want all applies to
be the same, set them all to 1. If you have three applies and want one to be
stronger than the other two, set them 2, 1, 1. The game engine will choose
the final numbers for these.

You can also set applies to be negative, to give a penalty to that trait and
get bonus points for the item's positive traits. Negatives should be set based
on how negative you want them to be, NOT relative to the positive applies. The
final number for these will still be chosen by the game engine. -1 is a small
penalty, -3 is a larger one.

Some item types have values that are also set by the game engine. For these,
you should assign a positive number that's relative to the numbers you set
for applies (see above). For example, setting a weapon's damage to 1 gives it
the same weight as an apply of 1. If your item ONLY has one property to set
(e.g. drink container, which has no applies), you should just set its value to
1 because the actual number doesn't matter, so long as it's greater than 0.

Scaling based on item types:
 weapon - the "damage" value
 drink container - the "capacity" value
 food - the "fullness" value
 coins - the "coinamount" value
 missile weapons - the "damage" value
 arrow - the "damage" value
 pack - the "capacity" value
 potion - the "potionscale" value

Applies and item values of 0 are ignored and do not get any points assigned.

See also: OLC LEVELS
#d
"MAP OLC" "OLC MAP" "WORLD OLC" "MAP EDITOR" MAPEDIT

Usage:  .map <command>

The .olc map editor is a tool for modifying and customizing individual parts
of the map. Unlike the other editors, it doesn't use contextual menus. The
map editor commands make instant changes to the map where you're standing.

You can get help on any of the mapeditor commands with &yHELP MAPEDIT <COMMAND>&0.
The following commands are available:
 complete - Finishes the building you're standing in.
 decustomize - Removes custom icon, name, and description.
 deleteexit - Removes an exit (careful about cutting off building interiors).
 deleteroom - Deletes the room you're standing in (interior rooms only).
 description - Customize the description on an interior room.
 exit - Add a new exit between two interior rooms (similar to interlink).
 icon - Customize the map icon.
 name - Customize the room title.
 passwalls - Able to move on the map unblocked by walls, interiors, etc.
 roomtype - Change the type of an interior room.
 terrain - Change the tile you're standing on.
 unclaimable - Make a tile or square of tiles unclaimable (or not).

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

See also: OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT COMPLETE"

Usage:  .map complete

This command finishes an unfinished building or room, if you're standing in
one. This is the easiest way for an immortal to build a building.

Example:
 > .map terrain plains
 > build largehouse north
 > .map complete

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DECUSTOMIZE"

Usage:  .map decustomize

This command removes any custom name, icon, and description from a map tile
or room.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DELETEEXIT" "MAPEDIT DELETE EXIT"

Usage:  .map deleteexit <direction>

This command removes an exit in one direction. It does not remove the other
side's corresponding exit back, and it does not delete the room that was
linked to that exit.

You should be careful not to leave orphaned rooms or areas that players cannot
get back out of.

See also: MAPEDIT DELETE ROOM, MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DELETEROOM" "MAPEDIT DELETE ROOM"

Usage:  .map deleteroom ok

This commmand deletes the room you are standing in. It only works on interior
(designated) rooms, and cannot be used out on the map. It will automatically
delete any exits that link to the room you're in.

Be careful about deleting rooms in the middle of buildings, as you may orphan
part of the building and make it unreachable.

See also: MAPEDIT DELETE EXIT, MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DESCRIPTION" "CUSTOM DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .map description set
        .map description none

This command allows you to set or remove a custom description on the room you
are standing in. This generally only applies to interior (designated) rooms,
but it can also be used to create custom roadsigns on roads (which show their
custom description as a sign).

See also: MAP OLC, ROADSIGN
#d
"MAPEDIT EXIT"

Usage:  .map exit <direction> <vnum>
        .map exit <direction> <new>

This command allows you to add new exits or rooms to an existing map building.
Unlike designate, adding new rooms this way is not limited by the size of the
building.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT ICON"

Usage:  .map icon <icon>
        .map icon none

This command allows you to add or remove a custom icon for a map tile. Like
all icons, it must be 4 characters wide (not counting color codes). Custom
icons must always start with a color code (usually &&0).

Remember that the map may be rotated for some players (especially new or drunk
players), so using multiple icons to give the appearance of a larger structure
on the map may not look correctly for all players.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .map name <name>
        .map name none

This command allows you to set or remove a custom room title on the map or in
designated rooms.

Important notes:
- Room titles are colored by the banner of the empire that owns them, so you
  should avoid color codes in them.
- Room titles are shown in some lists (e.g. the territory command), so they
  should usually be short.
- Custom room titles can help players distinguish between things like different
  starting locations, if you name them well.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT PASSWALLS"

Usage:  .map passwalls

This toggle allows an immortal to roam freely on the map without being blocked
by terrain or buildings. When passwalls is active, the immortal cannot enter
the interior (designated) rooms of a building; they will instead move to the
next map tile in the direction that they were walking.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT ROOMTYPE" "MAPEDIT ROOM TYPE"

Usage:  .map roomtype <name>

This command allows you to change the type of a designated interior room, to
any available room type. Rooms are created with the building editor, and any
building with the ROOM flag can be set this way.

See also: MAP OLC, OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"MAPEDIT TERRAIN"

Usage:  .map terrain <type>

This command allows you to change the sector type (terrain) of a map tile.
It can be used to clear space for building an immortal's home, or to remove
a building on the map.

Example:
 > .map terrain Tower of Souls

See also: MAP OLC, MAPEDIT UNCLAIMABLE
#d
"MAPEDIT UNCLAIMABLE"

Usage:  .map unclaimable [size]

This command allows you to toggle the unclaimable status of the map tile you
are in, or of a larger area around it. The whole area is toggled on if the
room you're standing in is toggled on, and vice versa.

By tradition, EmpireMUD sets the area around starting locations as unclaimable
so that nobody can build guard towers that threaten players on the start spot.

Example:
 > .map terrain Tower of Souls
 > .map unclaimable 3

"MEDIT INTERACTION" "BEDIT INTERACTION" "OEDIT INTERACTION" "REDIT INTERACTION" "SECTEDIT INTERACTION" "CROPEDIT INTERACTION" "GEDIT INTERACTION" INTERACTIONS

Usage:  .interaction add <type> <quantity> <vnum> <percent> [exclusion code]
        .interaction change <number> <field> <value>
        .interaction copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .interaction remove <number | all>
        .interaction move <number> <up | down>

This command adds or removes an interaction. These are objects or mobs that are
generated by certain commands. Some are only used on mobs, while others are
only used on rooms. You can copy interactions from other mobs, buildings,
rooms, sectors, and crops -- this may save you time if many are the same.

Mob interaction types:
 BUTCHER - Items received when the Butcher ability is used.
 SKIN - Items received via the skin command.
 SHEAR - Items received when the shear command is used in a stable.
 BARDE - Mob loaded when the Barde ability is used in a stable.
 LOOT - Items dropped into the corpse when the mob is killed.
 
Object interaction types:
 LIGHT - Item something is converted into when lit on fire.

Room interaction types:
 DIG - Items received when using the dig action.
 FORAGE - Items received when using the Forage ability.
 FIND-HERB - Items found when picking, if the user has Find Herbs.
 HARVEST - Items received when harvesting a crop, OR when picking in an ORCHARD crop.
 GATHER - Items received from the gather action.
 ENCOUNTER - Hostile mob loaded when a random encounter triggers.

The percent may be anywhere from 0.01 to 100.00 and if the quantity is greater
than 1, the percent is only checked once for the entire quantity. If you want
each copy of an item to have its own percent roll, list them separately as
quantity 1.

The exclusion code (optional) may be any letter, which changes how random
interactions are chosen. All items with the same exclusion code have a cumu-
lative roll (meaning if the percents add up to 100, one of them is guaranteed)
but only one item from the same exclusion set will ever pass. The rest will
fail. If you don't set an exclusion code, the interaction is not exclusive and
always gets its own percent roll.

You can use '.interact move' to rearrange entries. Interactions are always
processed from top to bottom.

Example of a rare result from barding (order matters here):
 1. BARDE: 1x an epic warhorse .50% (e)
 2. BARDE: 1x a warhorse 100% (e)

Example of possible multiple results from shear:
 1. SHEAR: 1x some wool 100.00%
 2. SHEAR: 1x some wool 50.00%
 3. SHEAR: 1x some wool 5.00%

#d
"MEDIT KEYWORDS"

Usage:  .keywords <keywords>

This command updates the keywords on a mob. The keywords are a list of single
words that can be used to target the mob. It should include any words from the
mob's short or long description that identify the mob.

Example:
 name: a fiery dragon
 long description: A huge red dragon is flying overhead!
 keywords: dragon fiery huge red

#d
"MEDIT MAXLEVEL" "MEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This command determines the maximum level a mobile will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. If you're unsure how to scale the mob, check the levels on some players.

If you set the maxlevel to 0, there will be no maximum and the mob can scale
to any level over the minimum.

See also: MEDIT MINLEVEL, OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT MINLEVEL" "MEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This command determines the minimum level a mobile will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. If you're unsure how to scale the mob, check the levels on some players.

If you set the minlevel to 0, there will be no lower limit and mobs can scale
to any level under the maximum.

See also: MEDIT MAXLEVEL, OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT MOVETYPE" "MEDIT MOVE TYPE"

Usage:  .movetype <type>

The move type determines what message is sent when the mob moves. Sometimes
other types are substituted, for example a flying mob always says "flies" even
if its move type is different.

See also: OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT NAMESET" "MEDIT NAME SET"

Usage:  .nameset <set>

Name sets are used for mobs that have #n in their strings. This feature allows
a mob to appear to be unique by giving each copy of the mob a random name from
the set. The various name sets contain different themed names.

See also: OLC MOBILES, #n
#d
"MEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION" "MEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .longdescription <string>

The long description is the text you see when the mobile is in the room. Its
name should appear somewhere near the beginning, and the rest should be a
complete sentence indicating that the mobile is present.

Examples:
There is a cow munching on some grass.
A fiery dragon circles overhead.
You're standing at the foot of a huge giant!

See also: OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT SCRIPTS" "OEDIT SCRIPTS" "REDIT SCRIPTS"

Usage:  .script add [position] <trigger vnum>
        .script copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .script remove <number | all>

You can attach triggers to mob, objects, and room templates using this option.
Triggers run in the order they appear in the OLC list, so you can optionally
choose which position to insert them at, if there are multiple scripts. If you
don't give a position, it will put it at the end.

When you save your olc editor, all live copies of the thing you were editing
should get the updated script list right away.

See also: OLC MOBILES, OLC OBJECTS, OLC TRIGGERS, VNUM
#d
"MEDIT SEX"

Usage:  .medit sex <male | female | neutral>

This command sets the sex of the NPC. This matters mostly in action messages,
where it determines the pronouns. Animals are almost always set to neutral,
while humans should always be set to male or female. Use your best judgment.

See also: OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION" "MEDIT SHORT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .shortdescription <string>

The 'short description' is the trait that's shown in lists, in action messages,
and almost everywhere else except when a player types 'look' in the room (where
the long description is shown instead). This should be short, should generally
begin with a/an/the unless it's a proper noun, and should not be capitalized
(again unless it's a proper noun).

Examples:
 the dragon
 a mongoose
 Charles the Great

See also: MEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION
#d
"OEDIT AFFECTS"

Usage:  .affects [add | remove] <flags>

This command adds, removes, or toggles a set of affect flags. These flags
are set on the character who equips this object, as if they had a spell cast
on them.

See also: AFFECT FLAGS, OLC OBJECTS
#d

See also: HARNESS, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT APPLY" APPLIES

Usage:  .apply add <value> <type>
        .apply remove <number | all>

Applies are bonuses (or penalties) that an item gives to the player who is
using it. The following applies are available. Most are self-explanatory:
 STRENGTH - characters can't use an item that would reduce them below 1 strength

"OEDIT ARMORTYPE" "OEDIT ARMOR TYPE"

Usage:  .armortype <type>

Armor items may have several different types set. This determines which ability
is required to wear the item. If an item does not need to be skill-restricted,
use the WORN item type instead of ARMOR.

mage - Should provide caster or healer traits and no real protection.
light - Should provide melee DPS traits.
medium - Should provide both DPS and tank traits, such as to-hit and dodge.

#d
"OEDIT ARROWTYPE" "OEDIT ARROW TYPE"

Usage:  .arrowtype <letter>

Arrow type is a property you set on missile weapons (e.g. bows) and arrow
objects, to match the two up together. An arrow object any kind (whether it's
actually an arrow, or a bolt, or whatever) can only be used on a bow with the
same arrow type.

Arrow types are single letters, like 'A', 'B', and so on. You can find a list
of existing items and their arrowtypes by typing "show arrowtypes".

Common arrow types:
 A - arrows

#d
"OEDIT AUTOMINT" "OEDIT AUTO MINT"

Usage:  .automint <on|off>

This allows a wealth item to be automatically minted into coins by Workforce.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT BOOK"

Usage:  .book <book id>

You can create book objects to place in your adventure zones. Like ordinary
books, their name will be overridden by the name set in the book editor. You
can see the book id of any book you've written by typing "bookedit list" (it's
the number in the [brackets]).

See also: BOOKEDIT, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CAPACITY"

Usage:  .capacity <number>

Some items have a capacity trait, which determines how many items (or drinks)
they can hold. In the case of drink containers, the capacity is measured in
hours of thirst-quenching. In all other cases, this capacity is number of
items (LARGE items count double).

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT CONTENTS, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CATAPULT"

Usage:  .catapult

This trait, set on cart objects, turns the cart into a catapult and allows it
to be used with the catapult command. Using .catapult again will toggle it off.

See also: CATAPULT
#d
"OEDIT CHARGES"

Usage:  .charges <number>

Some items have a 'charges' trait which determines how many times they can
be used. You need to provide at least 1 charge for the item to be useful.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT COINAMOUNT" "OEDIT COIN AMOUNT"

Usage:  .coinamount <number>

This sets how many coins are in a COINS-type object. You can't set what empire
the coins belong to; they will always be "other".

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT TYPE, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CONTAINERFLAGS" "OEDIT CONTAINER FLAGS"

Usage:  .containerflags [add | remove] <flags>

This command adds or removes container flags.

Available flags are:
 CLOSEABLE - the container may be closed and opened
 CLOSED - the container is closed when it loads

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CONTENTS"

Usage:  .contents <amount>

Some items with a capacity, such as drink containers, also have a 'contents'
property. This is how full they are when they are loaded or dropped into the
world. If you want an item to start out empty, set its contents to 0. If you
want it to start out full, set it to the same amount as the capacity.

See also: OEDIT CAPACITY, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CUSTOM" "CUSTOM MESSAGES"

Usage:  .custom add <type> <message>
        .custom remove <number | all>

You can set custom messages on objects for various actions. These messages
may use the tokens $n/$e/$s/$m for name/he/his/him for the player using the
item, $p for the name of the item, $a for a/an for the item.

If you set more than one message of the same type, one will be chosen at
random each time.

Message types:
 build-to-char - Shown to the character when the item is built into a building.
 build-to-room - Shown to the room when the item is built into a building.
 instrument-to-char - Shown every few seconds to the person playing the instrument.
 instrument-to-room - Shown every few seconds to the room when someone is playing an instrument.
 eat-to-char - Shown to the person when they eat the item.
 eat-to-room - Shown to the room when a person eats an item.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT DAMAGE"

Usage:  .damage <amount>

This lets you set the damage on various types of weapons. Usually this amount
of damage is added to another number, like bow damage + arrow damage, or
strength + weapon damage.

When you set the damage, it will also give you the weapon's current DPS. This
is the amount of damage it deals per second, given its current attack type
or slow/fast flags.

Weapons that are slow but strong deal the same DPS as weapons that are fast
but weak. Some strategies prefer one way or the other. For most purposes, two
weapons are considered equal if their DPS (not their raw damage) is equal.

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

#d
"OEDIT EXTRA" "OEDIT EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS" "BEDIT EXTRA" "BEDIT EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS" "REDIT EXTRA" "REDIT EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS"

Usage:  .extra add <keywords>
        .extra remove <number | all>
        .extra keywords <number> <new keywords>
        .extra description <number>

This command lets you add or edit extra descriptions. These are additional
descriptions that the player may 'look' at. 

For objects, the object's main description is set on the 'lookdescription'
command.

The keywords are a list of different words the player may look at, and the
associated description is shown when they do. When you add a new extra, it
immediately takes you into the string editor to write the description for the
keywords you chose.

Example in-game of a locket with extra description keyword "photo":
 > look locket
   The locket is worn but has a photo inside.
 > look photo
   It's a photo of a young girl.

  OLC ROOM TEMPLATES
#d
"OEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Object flags allow additional properties to be set on objects, with various
effects. Never set a flag marked with an * (asterisk).

Available flags:
 CHAIR - can be sat upon using the 'sit' command
 PLANTABLE - can be planted as a crop (see OEDIT PLANTS)
 LIGHT - lights up the room at night
 SUPERIOR - crafted by a master craftsman, adds the (superior) tag
 LARGE - takes up 2 inventory slots, adds the (large) tag
 *CREATED - created by a god command
 1-USE - is destroyed when un-equipped
 SLOW - for weapons, attacks slower
 FAST - for weapons, attacks faster
 ENCHANTED - unstorable, magical, and vulnerable to Disenchant, adds (enchanted) tag
 JUNK - will be cleaned up on the ground, even on claimed land -- worthless
 CREATABLE - can be created using the 'create' command (usually resources)
 SCALABLE - item can be scaled (see HELP ITEM SCALING)
 TWO-HANDED - weapon requires both hand slots
 BOE - item binds to a player when it is equipped
 BOP - item binds to a player when it is picked up
 STAFF - counts as a staff (even if it doesn't have a staff weapon type)
 UNCOLLECTED-LOOT - will decay on the ground if no player gets it
 *KEEP - player has marked the object with the 'keep' command
 TOOL-PAN - can pan for gold if holding this
 TOOL-SHOVEL - acts as a shovel for dig and excavate
 !AUTOSTORE - will not autostore (e.g. furniture)
 HARD-DROP - was dropped by a HARD mob (CAUTION: it will set this itself when dropped as loot)
 GROUP-DROP - was dropped by a GROUP mob (CAUTION: it will set this itself when dropped as loot)
 GENERIC-DROP - never receives the HARD-DROP/GROUP-DROP flags

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT FULLNESS"

Usage:  .fullness <hours>

This determines how long a food item can make you full for when eaten, in game
hours (75 second intervals). The 'eat' command only eats part of food if the
player isn't hungry enough to eat the whole thing, which displays as "You eat
some of <item name>."

Examples of good fullness numbers:
 snack foods (apple) - 6 hours
 baskets of food (apples) - 24 hours
 prepared food (bread) - 48 hours

Foods should also have a decay timer set. Traditionally, more-prepared foods
take longer to decay, rather than basic it strictly on realism.

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT DECAY, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT KEYWORDS"

Usage:  .keywords <list>

Keywords are the terms you can use to interact with an item. This is a list
of all available one-word terms. Any identifying word in an object's name
or long description should go in the keywords.

Usually the most significant or unique word goes first in the keyword list.
Some commands use the first keyword to auto-repeat, so if the keywords would
be ambiguous like "ore iron", you can add "ironore" as the first keyword to
help the game identify the correct object for repeating commands like smelt.

Examples:
 name: a wailing phaester
 long description: A huge, wailing phaister is lying here.
 keywords: phaester wailing huge

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT LIQUID"

Usage:  .liquid <type>

Drink containers hold a certain type of liquid. This only matters if the
'contents' property is greater than 0, as an empty drink container holds no
liquid at all. If a drink container is emptied, it can be refilled with any
type of liquid.

The name of the liquid is automatically appended to the name of the item, so
when "a flask" is full of ale, it becomes "a flask of ale". Keep this in mind
when naming your drink containers.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION" "OEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION" "LONG DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .longdescription <text>

The long description is shown when the item is on the ground and the player
types 'look'. This is always a full sentence that describes the object as
present in the room. The name of the object should always be near the beginning
of the long description.

Examples:
 A sword is lying in the dirt.
 There is a sign stamped into the ground.
 A strange, humming orb is floating here.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT LOOKDESCRIPTION" "OEDIT LOOK DESCRIPTION" "LOOK DESCRIPTION" "ACTION DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .lookdescription

The look description (also called action description) is shown when a player
looks at or examines an object. For simple, common objects, this should tell
the player how to use the object. For decorative or impressive objects, it
should be a description of the object's majesty.

The look description is set in the string editor. If it is less than 80
characters long, it will fit on one line and should not be indented. If it
goes any longer than that, you should use /fi to format it with indent inside
the string editor.

See also: OLC OBJECTS, STRING EDITOR
#d
"OEDIT MATERIAL"

Usage:  .material <type>

Items are made out of various materials. This is used to determine if they can
float in water, what message is shown when they decay, and is also used by the
sacrifice and create commands to determine which resources the god gets or
spends.

Choose the material that best fits your object. If there isn't one that fits
at all, contact the programmer to discuss adding a new one. But remember, the
material doesn't need to be exact. It just needs to be close enough.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT MAXLEVEL" "OEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This command determines the maximum level a objecdt will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. There is a full guide to item scaling at HELP ITEM SCALING.

If you set the maxlevel to 0, there will be no maximum and the obj can scale
to any level over the minimum.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT MINLEVEL, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT MINLEVEL" "OEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This command determines the minimum level a object will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. There is a full guide to item scaling at HELP ITEM SCALING.

If you set the minlevel to 0, there will be no lower limit and objs can scale
to any level under the maximum.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT MAXLEVEL, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT MISSILESPEED" "OEDIT MISSILE SPEED"

Usage:  .missilespeed <number>

This trait determines how fast a missile weapon (e.g. a bow) attacks in combat.
You cannot choose your own speed; you must pick from a list. You should always
specify the number in the list as your argument to this command.

The 'speed' trait is the number of seconds between attacks in combat, so a
lower number means a faster weapon. In that way, the name is backwards.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT STORAGE"

Usage:  .storage add <building vnum> [flags]
        .storage remove <number | all>

This command lets you set where an object may be stored. An object type may
have any number of storage locations.

Available flags:
 WITHDRAW - This item requires the "withdraw" empire privilege.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT PLANTS"

Usage:  .plants <crop vnum>

Any object with the PLANTABLE flag needs its crop set. This actually uses
item value 2, so many object types will have conflicting values. You should
never set a weapon as plantable, for example.

PLANTABLE works best on OTHER and FOOD items. You shouldn't use any other type
unless you have a very good reason (and that type doesn't use value 2 for
anything else).

See also: PLANT, OEDIT TYPE, OLC OBJECTS, VNUM
#d
"OEDIT POISON"

Usage:  .poison <type>

This sets which type of poison the item contains. Poisons are used by the
Stealth skill tree, and the poison item is lost when it runs out of charges.

Never set a poison type marked with an * (asterisk).

See also: POISON, OEDIT CHARGES, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT POTION"

Usage:  .potion <type>

This sets which type of potion the item contains. Potion items are used up
(removed) when quaffed. Each potion type has a pre-determined effect.

Never set a potion type with an * (asterisk).

See also: POTION, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT POTIONSCALE"

Usage:  .potionscale <number>

This sets the "scale level" of a potion's effects, usually corresponding to a
player level.

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

Never set a potion type with an * (asterisk).

See also: ITEM SCALING, POTION, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT QUANTITY"

Usage:  .quantity <number>

This sets how many arrows are available from a given ARROW object.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT ROOMVNUM"

Usage:  .roomvnum <vnum>

This command sets the target for a portal object. Portals allow players to
travel instantly to another room anywhere in the world. You need a separate
object to represent each end of the portal, as they each target the other's
room. Of course, you can also have one-way portals by only putting an object
on one side.

If you are using the portal in an instanced adventure zone, the target should
be a *room template* vnum, not a real room. When the portal loads, it will be
linked to its instance's version of that room template. Portals cannot link
from the inside of an adventure zone to the outside, or to a room in a
different instance.

If you use the portal in a linking rule of an adventure zone, you don't need
to set the room vnum targets at all. The instance-builder will do that for
you.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, OLC OBJECTS, OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, PORTAL, VNUM
#d
"OEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION" "OEDIT SHORT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .shortdescription <text>

An object's short description is the text that appears in sentences, and is
shown on many status screens. The name should be reasonably short and simple.
It should not be capitalized unless it contains a proper noun. Names should
always start with "a", "an", or "the" unless it wouldn't make sense in a
sentence.

If an object has a capital letter in its short description, the Reforge and
Refashion abilities will treat it as already "named" and will not allow it to
be renamed.

All of the words in the object name should also appear in the keywords list,
except a/an/the.

Sample names:
 a flaming broadsword
 the chain of doom
 Amerigo's map
 the eye of the Grasper of Apiaries (this one is pushing it for length)

"OEDIT TIMER" "DECAY TIMER" TIMER

Usage:  .timer <hours>

This determines how long an item lasts before it decays and is lost. This can
be used to make any item temporary, but it is used especially on food, drink
containers, portals, and similar. The decay timer only counts down while the
item is in-game, so players who log out do not lose their items. Timers are
measured in game hours/ticks (75 second intervals).

If you set the timer to 0 or -1 in the editor, the item does not decay.

Unlike all other types, when a drink container decays, only its contents go
bad and are poured out.

Food items are usually set to last longer if they are harder to get/make, and
shorter if they are found easily.

Remember, items left on the ground outdoors will decay or bestored after 3
real hours, regardless of their decay timers.

#d
"OEDIT TYPE"

Usage:  .type <type>

An object's type is its main property. This determines how it behaves in the
game, and determines what other properties need to be set for it. When you
change an object's type, some properties (like damage) will be reset to 0.

Never set any type that is marked with an * (asterisk).

Available types:
 UNDEFINED - type not set
 WEAPON - a melee weapon, or a caster weapon (requires .wear WIELD)
 WORN - clothing
 OTHER - miscellaneous
 CONTAINER - a chest, holds items on the ground (never set wear TAKE)
 DRINKCON - a drink container, like a flask
 FOOD - edible
 BOAT - lets you move on river/ocean, like a canoe
 PORTAL - transports a player to another place (never set .wear TAKE)
 *BOARD - a message board
 *CORPSE - a corpse
 COINS - a pile of coins
 *MAIL - a letter
 WEALTH - adds to empire wealth when stored
 CART - a cart or wagon
 *SHIP - a sailing ship
 * - unused
 * - unused
 MISSILE_WEAPON - a bow, or similar (requires .wear RANGED)
 ARROW - ammunition for missile weapons
 INSTRUMENT - a musical instrument -- must set custom messages
 SHIELD - for blocking attacks (requires .wear HOLD)
 PACK - expands the player's inventory (requires .wear PACK)
 POTION - gives an effect when quaffed
 POISON - adds an effect to melee combat
 ARMOR - requires certain skills to wear
 BOOK - can be read like a library book

You can get specific help on each of these via HELP <type> ITEM

#d
"OEDIT VALUE1" "OEDIT VALUE2" "OEDIT VALUE3"

Usage:  .value1 <number>
        .value2 <number>
        .value3 <number>

For item type OTHER, you can manually set the three object values. For all
other item types, these values are used for things like damage, fullness,
and capacity.

If you set your OTHER object with the PLANTABLE flag, value2 is replaced by
the 'plants' property. If you can't see the plants property in the editor,
it means your value2 is invalid for planting and you should set your value2
back to 0.

Some special procedures may use the object values of an OTHER object; the
significance of these values would depend on the special procedure.

See also: OEDIT PLANTS, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT WEALTH"

Usage:  .wealth <value>

This property determines how much an item adds to an empire's wealth when
stored. It is only available on the WEALTH item type, and usually when you
add storage for the item, you should set the WITHDRAW flag on the storage so
that only people with the correct permission can withdraw it.

See also: OEDIT STORAGE, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT WEAPONTYPE" "OEDIT WEAPON TYPE" "WEAPON TYPES" "ATTACK TYPES"

Usage:  .weapontype <type>

 3. slice - axe (used by the chopping chore)
 4. jab - rapier
 5. stab - dagger (used by some Stealth skills)

"OEDIT WEAR"

Usage:  .wear [add | remove] <flags>

The wear flags determine which parts of the body an item can be worn on, as
well as whether or not it can be picked up (TAKE). Be careful how many wear
slots you set, as each one means another copy of the same item can be used
concurrently.

Only items set TAKE can be picked up off the ground.

Weapons can often by set WIELD and HOLD and used in both positions.

Missile weapons and instruments must be set HOLD.

#d
"OLC ABORT"

Usage:  .abort

This command closes your current OLC editor without saving. ALL YOUR CHANGES
ARE LOST. Don't worry, the .abort command can't be abbreviated, so ".a" will
never accidentally lose your changes.

done.

See also: OLC ABORT, OLC SAVE, VNUM
#d
"OLC EDITOR"

The .olc editor is the interface for making changes to objects, mobs, and
other in-game features. It has a simple menu, but doesn't take you out of the
game (except for the string editor). This means you can still access help files
and chat on public channels while editing.

You can open a new editor with ".o edit <vnum>" (for objects, for example).
You can close the editor with .save or .abort.

#d
"REDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

All rooms need a good description. The description should be at least 3 full
lines, and should always be formatted with the /fi option in the string
editor. Generally descriptions should not run more than about 6 lines.


See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, STRING EDITOR
#d
"REDIT EXITS"

Usage:  .exit add <dir> <room template vnum> [keywords if door]
        .exit change <number> <field> <value>
        .exit remove <number | all>

Room templates can exit only to other room templates -- never to real rooms
or world locations. The starting room of an adventure zone will also always
exit back to the place in the world it linked from (if it linked from a
building). Other exits can be added in any direction, or choose RANDOM and a
direction will be chosen for you.

If you wish to create a door that opens and closes, specify door keyword(s) at
the end of the exit add.

You can use 'change' to alter an exit's direction, target, or keywords.
Changing the keywords to 'none' removes the door.

Examples:
 > .exit add random 1234
 > .exit add down 1236 trapdoor door
 
You can use .matchexits to automatically create the exits back to other rooms
that link to the one you're currently editing.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, REDIT MATCH EXITS, VNUM
#d
"REDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following room template flags are available:
 OUTDOOR - Affected by sun.
 DARK - Always requires a light. (By default, rooms are dark at night.)
 LIGHT - Never requires a light.
 !MOB - Mobs will not wander into the room (they may still be spawned there).
 PEACEFUL - No combat allowed.
 NEED-BOAT - Requires a boat, swimming, or fly.
 !TELEPORT - Cannot teleport in or out.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES
#d
"REDIT MATCHEXITS" "REDIT MATCH EXITS"

Usage:  .matchexits

This command will look for other rooms in the same adventure zone that link
to this one, and attempt to create matching exits. This makes the other side
of exits easier to add.

The exit's flags and keywords, if any, are automatically copied.

Matched exits will always lead back in the opposite direction of the exit they
matched (an east exit links back west), unless you are using "random" exits,
in which case they will be random on both sides. When the adventure zone is
instantiated, matching random exits will be linked in the same logical
direction (a random exit linking to a random exit may, for example, go
north-south). They will not end up with wildly different random directions.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, REDIT EXITS
#d
"REDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

The title is shown above the room description. Like all titles, these should
be title-cased (Named Like a Book), should not have punctuation at the end,
and should be a reasonably short description of the room.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES
#d
"REDIT SPAWNS"

Usage:  .spawn add <type> <vnum> <percent> <limit>
        .spawn change <number> <vnum | percent | limit> <value>
        .spawn copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .spawn remove <number | all>

Spawn commands cause any OBJ or MOB to load in the room whenever the adventure
zone is reset (if their percent check passes, and there aren't more than the
limit).

The limit is only for the current instance, so setting a limit of 3 means that
each copy of this adventure zone can have 3 of the object or mob at a time.

This is different from the spawn data set on crops, sectors, and buildings.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, ADVEDIT RESET TIME, VNUM
#d
"SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS"

Usage:  .buildflags [add | remove] <flags>

The buildflags for a sector are checked against the buildon or buildfacing
flags of a building craft recipe, to determine if this sector is a valid place
to build. A building may be built on this sector if at least one flag from its
'buildon' appears in the sector's 'buildflags'.

Available flags:
 water - any type of water tile
 plains - a flat, temperate sector like plains
 mountain - a rough tile like a mountain
 forest - a temperate forest of various types
 desert - a flat, arid sector
 river - a fresh-water sector
 jungle - any jungle tile
 * - 
 ocean - a salt-water tile
 oasis - an arid water source
 crops - any crop tile, should ONLY be used for 'buildfacing'
 grove - an arid forest tile like a desert grove
 swamp - a swamp-type tile
 any forest - a broader category of forests usually used for 'buildfacing'
 open building - does not apply to buildflags -- do not use

See also: CEDIT BUILDON, CEDIT BUILDFACING, OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT COMMANDS"

Usage:  .commands <list>
        .commands none

The commands list is shown below the map, and is meant to help newbies
understand how to use the sector. If the sector can be chopped down, list
'chop' as a command. If it has dig data, put 'dig' in the list.

The commands list is usually put in alphabetic order to look cleaner and less
scattered. The whole list is displayed in cyan, so you should not include any
color codes in the commands list.

For sectors with the CROP flag combined with a crop with the ORCHARD flag,
the orchard command list is shown instead of the default. For all other crops,
the sector's command list is used. For buildings, the commands list from the
building data is used instead.

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT EVOLUTIONS"

Usage:  .evolution add <type> [value] <percent> <becomes sector vnum>
        .evolution remove <number | all>

This command lets you add or remove an evolution from a sector. Evolutions are
rules that describe how the sector changes over time. Some evolutions change
the world periodically on their own; others are triggered by player action.

No matter how small you set the percentages on evolutions, if they run on their
own, they'll eventually succeed. Percentages may be set from 0.01 to 100.00.
Evolutions are automatically sorted by type and by percentage. Only one will
be called at a time -- the first one whose percentage check passes.

Available types ([value] isn't used unless specified):
 CHOPPED-DOWN - Sector to become when chopped by a player; value is the number
    of trees you receive.
 CROP-GROWS - Sector to become when the crop finishes growing (Seeded -> Crop).
 ADJACENT-ONE - Called when this sector is next to a certain other sector
    (value is the sector vnum that it's adjacent to).
 ADJACENT-MANY - Called when this sector is next to at least 6 of another
    sector (value is the sector vnum that it's adjacent to many of).
 RANDOM - Checked periodically and called it if passes.
 TRENCH-START - Sector this one becomes if a person starts to excavate.
 TRENCH-FULL - Sector this one becomes, if it's a trench, when it fills up.
 NEAR-SECTOR - Checked when this sector is within 2 tiles of another sector
    (value is the sector vnum that must be nearby).
 PLANTS-TO - Sector this one becomes when you start to plant a crop on it.
 MAGIC-GROWTH - Sector this one becomes if it is magically forced to grow.

Examples:
 Jungle: .evolution add CHOPPED-DOWN 1 50% 28
 Jungle: .evolution add CHOPPED-DOWN 1 100% 27
 Plains: .evolution add ADJACENT-MANY 4 .02% 1

#d
"SECTEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Available sector flags:
 LOCK-ICON - a random icon is chosen when the terrain changes to this, and kept
 IS-ADVENTURE - used only for adventure rooms
 NON-ISLAND - won't be detected as part of an island by the island detection system
 CHORE - This sector may have a chore (required, or the chore will never trigger)
 !CLAIM - Cannot be claimed.
 START-LOCATION - A starting location for players; prevents combat here
 FRESH-WATER - Requires a boat, counts as a river
 OCEAN - Requires a boat, counts as ocean
 DRINK - Provides drinkable water; can also be used from adjacent rooms
 HAS-CROP-DATA - Has an associated crop (like a seeded field or a crop tile)
 CROP - Is a crop (visually replaced by crop data); you should also set HAS-CROP-DATA
 LAY-ROAD - The lay command here can be used to create a road
 IS-ROAD - This tile is a road
 CAN-MINE - The tile is mine-able; this allows the Prospect ability
 SHOW-ON-POLITICAL-MAPOUT - Still appears on the political version of the graphical map
 MAP-BUILDING - This sector represents a building on the map; shown using building data
 INSIDE-ROOM - This sector represents an interior (designated) ROOM building
 COUNTS-AS-CITY - On empire territory count, this tile counts as in-city anywhere
 OBSCURE-VISION - Players can't be seen here; also blocks catapults and towers
 IS-TRENCH - Sector counts as a trench and fills with water
 * - unused
 ROUGH - This is rough, raised terrain, like a mountain
 SHALLOW-WATER - The tile has water but requires no boat (like a swamp)

#d
"SECTEDIT ICONS" "CROPEDIT ICONS"

Usage:  .icons add <type> <color code> <icon>
        .icons remove <number | all>

EmpireMUD uses four different seasons and the biggest change between them is
that sectors look different at different times of year. You can also specify
an icon for ANY season. The <type> parameter is where you specify which season,
and a list of valid types is shown on the olc display for the sector.

If more than one icon is available for a given season (or from season + any),
one is chosen at random. If you want to have random icons available, but want
one pre-selected, set the LOCK-ICON sector flag. Be warned, however, that once
an icon is locked, it remains the same in any season.

For icons, the base color is separate from the icon, so the icon does not
need to start with a color code (unless it's different from the base you set).
You can also use the &&? color code to specify the base color.

The olc editor display shows the rendered (colored) icon, its base color code,
and then the icon with raw, unrendered && codes.

See additional info at HELP SPECIAL ICONS.

Example:
 > .icon add summer &&g .&&0[]&&?.

"SECTEDIT MOVECOST" "SECTEDIT MOVE COST" "SECTEDIT MOVEMENT COST"

Usage:  .movecost <number>

Each sector has a movement cost when a player enters or leaves it. You can
look at other existing sectors for an idea of what an appropriate cost is.

The cost for a player to move from one sector to another is the average of the
costs of those two sectors. Open buildings have a cost that is the average of
their current sector (building) and the sector they were built upon (e.g.
mountain).

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The sector name is generally one word (sometimes two), singular (Hill not
Hills), and capitalized. It's important that it doesn't conflict with the
name of another sector, so you should try to make them unique. Sometimes, this
just means adding a second word to the name ("Sandy Trench" vs "Trench").

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT ROADSIDEICON" "ROADSIDEICON" "ROADSIDE ICON" "ROAD SIDE ICON"

Usage:  .roadsideicon <character>

The roadside icon is a single-character icon that's used when map tiles are
built around things like roads. This should be a single character that looks
reasonably like the whole sector tile. It does not include a color code -- it
will use the color code of the full icon that would otherwise be displayed.

Examples:
 Plains (....): .
 Forest (^^^^): ^
 Mountain (/\/\): ^

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

The title is shown above the map on most sectors (except sectors which are
buildings or crops, where the title comes from one of those instead). Like all
titles, these should be title-cased (Named Like a Book), should not have
punctuation at the end, and should be a reasonably short description of the
sector.

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SPECIAL ICONS" "ICON CODES"

The following special codes may be used in icons:
 @. - show the roadside icon for the base tile type here
 @e - show the roadside icon for the tile to the east
 @w - show the roadside icon for the tile to the west
 @u - show a 'v' if the tile to the west is a wall
 @U - show a 'V' if the tile to the west is a wall
 @v - show a 'v' if the tile to the east is a wall
 @V - show a 'V' if the tile to the east is a wall

The following special colors may be used in icons:
 &&? - The tile color of the base terrain.
 &&V - Wall color (walls are colored by enchantments).
#d
"STRING EDITOR" "TEXT EDITOR" "STRING EDITING"

Note: If you are using the string editor in-game, you must begin commands with
a comma (,). Only text you type starting with a , will be added to the string.
You can enter full-string-edit mode using ,/, (or turn that mode off the same
way).

The string editor is used to edit player descriptions, board messages, mail
letters, and more. You can type '/h' inside the string editor for a list of
its commands.

When the string editor opens, it shows you the contents of the string and
then gives a ] prompt. You are inserting text on a new line at the end of the
existing string. You can type '/l' to see the current string at any time.

TIP: If your string is longer than 80 characters (normal telnet window width),
use '/fi' to format it with indentation. This puts the whole thing into a
single paragraph, indented 3 spaces, with each line no longer than 80
characters.
#
"TRIGEDIT ARGUMENTS"

Usage:  .arguments <string>

This feature allows you to pass string arguments to the script.

See also: OLC TRIGGERS, TRIGEDIT NUMARG
#d
"TRIGEDIT ATTACHES"

Usage:  .attaches <type>

This determines what type of thing the trigger is meant to attach to. A trigger
that was designed for a mob probably wouldn't work very well attached to an
object.

The attach type also determines which event types you can choose.

See also: OLC TRIGGERS, TRIGEDIT TYPES
#d
"TRIGEDIT COMMANDS"

Usage:  .commands

The "commands" section is the body of the script: the set of commands that will
run when the trigger fires. It can include statements like "if", variables,
and other scripting functions.

The commands are edited in the text editor. When you're done editing the
commands, you should format them with /f -- this will clean up the code, as
well as check it to help make sure it will run safely.

See also: OLC TRIGGERS, TEXT EDITOR
#d
"TRIGEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

A trigger's name should be short and descriptive. This name is shown in many
lists, including the list of scripts when editing a mob or object.

Examples:
 > Cow behavior
 > Mob Fight - fireballs
 > Hestian Trinket recall

See also: OLC TRIGGERS
#d
"TRIGEDIT NUMARG" "TRIGEDIT NUMERIC ARGUMENT"

Usage:  .numarg <number>

The numeric argument (numarg) is a number that is passed to the script when
it runs.

See also: OLC TRIGGERS
#d
"TRIGEDIT TYPES"

Usage:  .types [add | remove] <flags>

You can set trigger types this way. These determine which events will set off
the script. The available types are determined by what the trigger attaches to.

#d
"#n" "#e" "#a"

Mob names can use certain special codes in order to dynamically add names.
You can use these codes in the short description, long description, and
keywords.

- #n  Pick a random name from the chosen nameset. If the gender is left neutral,
      it will also pick a random gender.

- #e  Empire name. For this to work, you need to set the mob as a claimed-only
      spawn on the map.

- #a  Empire adjective. See notes on #e.

See also: MEDIT NAMESET
#d
"ARMOR ITEM" "ARMOR OBJECT"

The ARMOR item type is similar to WORN, except that it requires specific
abilities to use it. Armor items may be set to any wear locations, but there
is a worn-as-armor slot that must always be this item type. Armor items will
scale higher than non-armor items.

Mage armor is for casters and healers.

Light armor is for melee damage characters and should give damage traits.

Medium armor is for PVP or solo adventuring, and should give both DPS and
   tank traits on the same item.

Heavy armor should always include -WITS, -STRENGTH, or other melee penalties.
   It should only include tank traits otherwise.
#d
"ARROW ITEM" "ARROW OBJECT"

The ARROW item type is used to create stacks of ammunition for the MISSILE
WEAPON type. Its damage is added to the missile weapon's own damage. Arrows
normally come in stacks of 10 and are named as "a quiver of arrows".

If the arrow is scalable, its damage bonus will scale. Applies don't matter on
arrow items because they are not equipped. Arrows only fire out of the player's
inventory.
#d
"BOARD ITEM" "BOARD OBJECT"

The BOARD item type is used only for in-game boards and cannot be set in OLC
because boards require code support as well.
#d
"BOAT ITEM" "BOAT OBJECT"

The BOAT item represents a canoe or raft, something reasonably small that the
player can take with them (although you should set the LARGE flag). A player
who has a boat will be able to cross water tiles and will be immune to water-
based random encounters, such as sharks.

This is not the type of item that players can go inside and explore; for that
you want a ship.
#d
"BOOK ITEM" "BOOK OBJECT"

The BOOK type is used along with the bookedit interface and EmpireMUD's library
system. You can spawn books in adventures by writing them in the book editor,
then assigning their book ID to a book object in your adventure zone. The
data from the book editor will override your short description, long desc-
ription, and look description.
#d
"CART ITEM" "CART OBJECT"

The CART item type represents a large item that can be moved by harnessing
animals to it. This includes carts, but also catapults.

To make a cart-type item, set the number of animals needed to pull it (1 or 2),
and set its capacity.

To make a catapult-type item, set the capacity to zero (it doesn't need to
move anything) and the number of animals required, plus the catapult property.
#d
"COINS ITEM" "COINS OBJECT"

The COINS type represents a pile of coins and will be converted from an object
to "real" coins when a player picks it up. Coins dropped by adventures should
always be "miscellaneous coins" rather than the coins of a specific empire, as
adventures should not rely on empires continuing to exist.

If your coin item is scalable, the coin value will be set by the scaling system
based on the player's level.

This should not be confused with the WEALTH item type.
#d
"CONTAINER ITEM" "CONTAINER OBJECT"

EmpireMUD does not use containers with the TAKE flag. These items should only
be used on the ground. If you want to raise inventory capacity, use the PACK
item type instead.

If you want to make a cart (or other movable container), use the CART type
instead.
#d
"CORPSE ITEM" "CORPSE OBJECT"

EmpireMUD does not currently allow content builders to add actual corpse
objects. You can use the CONTAINER item type if you don't set it as take-able,
or else you can use OTHER but won't be able to put items inside the corpse.

This item type itself is reserved for code use.
#d
"DRINKCON ITEM" "DRINKCON OBJECT" "DRINK ITEM" "DRINK OBJECT" "DRINK CONTAINER ITEM" "DRINK CONTAINER OBJECT"

This type represents two different things:

Some drink containers are kept in the player's inventory, like a canteen or
a cup. These should be relatively small in size, and you can set your item as
scalable in order to automatically determine how many drinks it will hold.

Other drink containers are like fountains, as no-take objects in the room
which can provide very large amounts of liquid to players. These shouldn't
be scalable, and you can set the capacity as high as you like.
#d
"FOOD ITEM" "FOOD OBJECT"

The FOOD item type represents something edible which will sustain the player.
Usually food will be higher level, with a longer timer and mour hours of full-
ness, only if it's harder to make or acquire. Simple foods received from the
forage or pick command should be short-lived and low-fullness no matter what
they represent. Something that takes several ingredients and a Trade ability
could last much longer.
#d
"INSTRUMENT ITEM" "INSTRUMENT OBJECT"

The INSTRUMENT item type can be used with the "play" command, and you must be
able to HOLD the instrument to do this.

You need to set at least one 'instrument-to-char' and one 'instrument-to-room'
custom message for the item. You can set more if you like, and each one will
be displayed randomly every few action ticks.

See also: OEDIT CUSTOM
#d
"MAIL ITEM" "MAIL OBJECT"

The MAIL item type is used internally and can't be set in builder-created items
or adventures. However, you can use the OTHER type with a look-description or
extra-description to get the same effect.
#d
"MISSILE WEAPON ITEM" "MISSILE WEAPON OBJECT"

The MISSILE WEAPON item type represents a bow, crossbow, or similar item. It
should always have the RANGED wear slot only, never wield or hold. In order to
use weapons of this type, players must also have matching ARROW items in their
inventory.

If the missile weapon is scalable, it will scale its own damage bonus.
#d
"OTHER ITEM" "OTHER OBJECT"

This is used for items that don't have another applicable type. It has no
base requirements to use it, and can represent almost anything. This type also
gives you access to edit the object's 3 generic values, which may be useful
for scripting.
#d
"PACK ITEM" "PACK OBJECT"

The PACK item type is used to increase how much players can carry. You should
always combine it with the PACK wear location, because it has no function in
any other slot.

Pack sizes are scalable, and you can also set various applies on the pack to
divert its scaling points to something other than inventory size. Like all
scaling options, the capacity and the applies will scale in proportion to
each other.

If you want items in other slots to add inventory capacity, use the INVENTORY
apply instead.
#d
"POISON ITEM" "POISON OBJECT"

The POISON item is applied on successful weapon attacks. Each player may only
have one active poison at a time.

Each time a poison is applied to a target, the poison object loses 1 charge,
until it is used up and discarded completely.
#d
"PORTAL ITEM" "PORTAL OBJECT"

Portals allow players to enter them and transport them from place to place.
You can use portals in several ways:

Adventures can use portals as their entrance/exit. You don't have to set a
target room on these, as it will be set when the adventure instance spawns.

You can create fixed portals inside of your adventures. In this case, use the
room template that the portal leads to as its target, instead of a live world
vnum.

You could also spawn portals using scripts. In this case, you should usually
set the portal's destination using the script that spawns it.
#d
"POTION ITEM" "POTION OBJECT"

Potions choose their effect from a pre-existing list. Some potion types, but
not all, can be scaled using the potionscale trait.

If you don't set your potion as scalable, you can manually set the potionscale
to a level to get that level of healing/etc.

If you do set your potion as scalable, you only need to set the potionscale to
1 and it will scale to the correct level.

Potions can only be used once, and then are lost.
#d
"SHIELD ITEM" "SHIELD OBJECT"

The SHIELD item type always needs the HOLD wear location, and in most cases it
should have the BLOCK apply set. Shields that don't have any BLOCK will be
ineffective at blocking, although this may be a desired effect.

Shields can only be used by players with the correct Battle ability and they
are primarily for tank characters, since they use up the off-hand hold slot.

If you want an off-hand item for casters, consider type OTHER.
#d
"SHIP ITEM" "SHIP OBJECT"

The SHIP item type represents large ships with interiors, which are piloted
around on water tiles by players inside. These cannot be built in OLC because
they still require code support to spawn them correctly. Future versions of
EmpireMUD will change this by using scripts to set up the interior; it is not
currently an option.
#d
"UNDEFINED ITEM" "UNDEFINED OBJECT"

The UNDEFINED item type should not be used for live items. If you need a
generic item, use type OTHER.
#d
"WEALTH ITEM" "WEALTH OBJECT"

The WEALTH type represents an object of value. These are not converted to money
like the COINS type is, but they can be minted into coins by players with a
mint. Wealth items contribute to an empire's total wealth when they are stored.

This item type has no effect unless the item is stored in normal storage.
#d
"WEAPON ITEM" "WEAPON OBJECT"

The WEAPON item type covers melee/caster weapons.

Notes:
- You should almost always set .wear WIELD.
- Small weapons, like daggers and swords, can also be .wear HOLD -- players
  will be able to use a second copy of the weapon in their hold slot, and
  may be able to attack with it in that slot if they have Dual Wield.
- The TWO-HANDED flag gives a weapon more scaling points and requires both
  hands, but only high-level players will be able to use it. Nobody below
  skill level 100 will have the correct ability.
- You must set the .weapontype property.
- You should set the .damage property to at least 1. If your item is scalable,
  this trait will scale along with the applies.
- Players usually prefer to enchant their own weapons, so you may wish to
  avoid pre-enchanted ones.
- The SLOW and FAST flags affect the rate of attack, but neither is really a
  bonus or penalty. They just help create more weapon diversity.
#d
"WORN ITEM" "WORN OBJECT"

The WORN item type is for clothing (not armor). There are no requirements to
use clothing and it usually isn't used to give apply bonuses, although shoes
and some other worn items are an exception to this.

If you are going to use the worn-as-armor wear location, or are planning to
give the item good stats, you should usually be using the ARMOR item type
instead.
