OLC .OLC "DOT OLC" "DOT-OLC"

EmpireMUD .olc: An on-line creation system for editing your world.

Usage:  .<type> <command>
        .<command>

The .olc system allows quick, easy in-game editing of objects, mobiles, crafts,
and more. The editor doesn't take you out of the game like some other OLC
systems, so you still have access to help files and public channels.

If you don't like the '.' command, you can also use "olc" instead. If you do,
you must type a space after the command.

Upper immortals can control the olc permissions of builders with the OLC
CONTROLS.

Available types are:
 .abil - abilities               .adv - adventures
 .aug - augments                 .arch - archetypes
 .b - buildings                  .book - books
 .c - crafts                     .class - classes
 .crop - crops                   .f - factions
 .g - globals                    .m - mobiles
 .map - map tiles/interiors      .morph - morphs
 .o - objects                    .q - quests
 .r - room templates             .sect - map sectors
 .skill - skills                 .soc - socials
 .t - scripts/triggers           .v - vehicles

Basic commands:
 . - typing '.' by itself shows your current editor
 abort - close your current editor WITHOUT SAVING
 copy <from vnum> <to vnum> - creates a copy of something and opens the editor
 delete <vnum> - deletes a vnum from the database, with all copies of it
 edit <vnum> - loads that vnum into the editor
 list <from vnum> <to vnum> - lists everything in that vnum range
 save - save your open editor and close it

Examples:
 > .o edit 1500
 > olc object edit 1500
 > .m list 50-60

BUILDING "BUILDING GUIDE" "BUILDING PARADIGM" "BUILDING CONTENT" "CONTENT BUILDING"

Content for EmpireMUD is built using the .olc system, which provides editors
for adventures, buildings (and designated rooms), craft (and building) recipes,
crops, mobs, objects, room templates, sectors, and triggers. This document
describes the game's current guidelines for building that content. For help
on the editors instead, see HELP OLC.

** Editor Notes **

Abilities (ABILEDIT):
- The mastery ability is mainly used to determine when a craft should be marked
  (superior). Do not apply mastery abilities to abilities that don't need this.

Adventures (ADVEDIT):
- When you set a min/max level for the adventure, mobs and items that don't
  have their own level limits will inherit the limits from the adventure.
- If you plan to use obj/room scripts that will do scaled damage, you should
  set one of the LOCK-LEVEL flags on the adventure, otherwise the game might
  not have a good level to use for those scripts. Mob scripts don't require it.
- The !NEARBY flag should only be used on zones where a player shouldn't find
  evidence of them nearby, like a thieves' den.
- Adventure scripts will ONLY run if they are 'Adventure Cleanup' scripts.

Archetypes (ARCHEDIT):
- Each set of archetypes has its own rules.
- If your EmpireMUD wants to add races, cultures, or other groupings, you
  can use new archetype types.
- 'Origins' should have a total of 11 attribute points (3 2 2 2 1 1).
- 'Origins' should have a total of 30 skill points; 'Hobbies' should have 5.
- 'Origins' should provide gear for: head, clothes, legs, feet, wield, hold.
- The hold slot is always a long-lasting light, like the newbie torch (2104).
- You should only set the BASIC flag on very simple archetypes. Most archetypes
  should only appear in the extended list.
- Lore is optional. If you have it, make sure it ends with no punctuation.

Augments (AUGEDIT):
- Augment names should be all lowercase.
- You should always require either an ability, or a certain object (or both) on
  each augment. No augments should be available without at least one of those.
- If you use the "requiresobject" option, that object will only be consumed on
  use if it is also in the resource list. Otherwise, having the object means
  a re-usable augment.
- Unlike crafts, it is safe to use SCALABLE items as resources and requires-
  objects, because augments are instant and non-refundable.
- CUMULATIVE-PRC and CHOOSE-LAST are not compatible. If you want a 100% last-
  choice for a cumulative set, give it 100% non-cumulative and the choose-last
  flag. If no cumulative choice is picked, it will be chosen.

Buildings (BEDIT):
- Designated rooms are also built in the building editor, using the ROOM flag.
- If a building has at least 1 Citizen, players can also set it as their home.
- If you change the triggers on a building/room, live copies are NOT auto-
  matically updated. You should use the "util resetbuildingtriggers" command if
  you want to reset triggers on live copies of the building.
- If you use a completion trigger to set up a building's interior, you should
  have the trigger detach itself upon finishing. It's an unnecessary use of
  processing time and RAM to leave triggers attached if they are guaranteed to 
  never run again.

Classes (CLASSEDIT):
- By convention, stock EmpireMUD has one class for every pair of level 100
  skills. This leaves no room for adding more classes unless you are re-
  designing that entire notion.
- A player will get assigned the class with the most matching skills, so adding
  a 100/100/75 class would give them a more specific version of the 100/100.
- Abilities can be on more than one class and more than one role within a class
  but you CANNOT assign an ability to both a class and a skill -- it would
  count toward purchased abilities in that skill tree.

Crafts (CEDIT):
- Soups are made using the COOK type and the SOUP flag. Instead of choosing an
  item to make, you choose a liquid, and the recipe will require a container
  of water to make the soup in.
- To make a recipe item, build an item ("an old recipe") and set it in a
  craft's requiresobject field. The player will only be able to see and use
  the craft if they have the item in their inventory. You can still also choose
  to require an Ability, for example an armor pattern that requires Armor-
  smithing. You should mention the recipe by name in the item's look
  description.
- To make an item that can be combined with another item, for example a spear-
  head that can be crafted into a spear, create a craft and set its requires-
  object to the spearhead (just like a recipe item, above). Then, also set the
  spearhead item as a resource to make the craft, too. You'll only be able to
  craft it when the spearhead is in your inventory, but it will consume the
  spearhead when you make it.
- If you use the requiresobject on a BUILD craft, it will always be consumed
  when the building is started. This is different from other types of crafts,
  where the requiresobject is only consumed if it's a "resource" too.
- Scalable objects should not be used as resources or required objects for
  craft recipes. These items aren't stored, so if they're refunded, they will
  scale to their minimum level and lose any modifications.
- SMELT crafts usually have a timer of 4.

Crops (CROPEDIT):
- Crop names are always lowercase because they are used to build sentences.
  They should also be plural (e.g. "apples", "rice").
- We don't usually give the crops different seasonal icons, but you can.
- The map region only matters if the crop grows in the wild (no !WILD flag).
- Crops should have a FORAGE interaction for a small single food item.
- Crops should have a HARVEST interaction for a plantable large item.
- The HARVEST interaction on orchards actually uses the pick command. You
  should usually use a 1x item for this interaction.
- Orchard crops need a CHOP interaction if they will give trees. Orchards are
  still choppable without this, though.

Factions (FEDIT):
- The REP-FROM-KILLS flag causes you to lose reputation if you kill a mob who
  belongs to this faction or its allies (SHARED-GAINS relationship), and gain
  repationship if you kill a mob from an enemy faction (INVERSE-GAINS). It
  doesn't matter if that other faction has the REP-FROM-KILLS flag or not.
- Two related factions don't have to have identical relationship flags, but
  there aren't very many good reasons not to.
- Reputation levels go Despised, Hated, ... Venerated, Revered. The Despised/
  Revered endcaps are good for min/max limits on factions. However, when
  checking faction reputation in quests and scripts, you should use the
  Hated/Venerated. Despised/Revered don't have ranges, and players can 'bump
  out' of those ranges by gaining/losing even 1 reputation point.
- See HELP FACTION SCRIPTING for tips on writing scripts.

Globals (GEDIT):
- All global tables must be approved by the head builder, because they apply
  to the entire game rather than just one adventure.
- If a global is set ADVENTURE-ONLY, it will only apply to mobs (etc.) in the
  adventure which its vnum falls into.
- In most cases (but not Mine Data), more than one global can trigger at the
  same time. This means two global loot tables might apply to one mob kill.
  You can lower the chance of an entire global set being checked by setting the
  percent on the global itself. If its percent fails, the interactions won't
  even be checked.
- If you use the CUMULATIVE-PRC flag, the game rolls a 0.01 - 100% chance once,
  and tracks the total percentages of each matching global until the first one
  that passes. No additional cumulative globals will pass at all, but globals
  that are not cumulative may still also trigger.
- The cumulative percent is always checked in ascending order of vnum. We
  acknowledge that this is not necessarily the best approach, and are open to
  suggestions on how to improve it.
- See also: MINE DATA GLOBAL, MOB INTERACTIONS GLOBAL

Map (MAPEDIT):
- Immortals are not generally permitted to make edits to the map. However,
  small aberrations may be fixed, and it's ok to make tiny (few-tile) edits
  for mortals if there is a good reason (and won't provide any kind of game
  advantage for the player).

Mobs (MEDIT):
- The most significant keyword should always be first. A black bat should put
  "bat" first. Handyman Joe should probably put "Joe" first. The first keyword
  may be used for sentence-building.
- If you don't set a min/max level on the mob, it may inherit them from the
  adventure zone it's in. Otherwise, they may scale to any level at all.
- We usually don't want mobs to be able to scale to any level, so mobs that
  spawn outside of adventure zones should almost alway shave a min/max set.
- Mobs that use the #n tag to pick from a generic name list will be assigned
  a random sex if you leave their sex "neutral".
- The HARD flag means a mob needs two players at its level, or one very good
  player.
- The GROUP flag will require a full group of 4 players at its level, or 3
  players working very hard, or perhaps 2 extremely good players.
- A mob with HARD and GROUP is a major boss fight and may take a lot of work
  even for a full 4-player group.
- ANIMAL mobs will take double damage from players with Hunt.
- Consider using a must-fight script (like a Leave trigger with "return 0")
  rather than the AGGR flag.
- If your mob spawns in a dark adventure, strongly consider giving it INFRA.
- Animal mobs usually need a BUTCHER and SKIN interaction.

Morphs (MORPHEDIT):
- Be sure to set the SCRIPT-ONLY flag if your morph isn't meant to show up in
  player morph lists.
- If you use a required object and the CONSUME-OBJ flag, be sure not to use a
  scalable item. Scalable items will refund at the wrong level.
- If the morph requires a class ability, you should also set the CHECK-SOLO
  flag. This is necessary to use it in the Solo role.

Objects (OEDIT):
- The most significant keyword should always be first. A fiery torch should put
  "torch" first. Joe's amazing magical wand should put "wand" first. The first
  keyword may be used to build sentences such as "You attack with your wand."
- Most equipment should be set SCALABLE, and there are very few acceptable
  reasons not to do so. We prefer you rely on the scaling engine rather than
  picking numbers for an object. See HELP ITEM SCALING.
- If you don't set a min/max level on the object, it will inherit the min/max
  from the adventure zone it spawns in. If it spawns outside an adventure zone,
  you should strongly consider a min/max on the object.
- Setting an item to ENCHANTED will make it scale higher, but players will not
  be able to enchant it themselves.
- Most equipment should be set bind-on-equip, included crafted items, so that
  a player can't use them for a while and then re-sell them. Crafters will
  prefer that each player has to buy a new item from, and it will also help to
  encourage players to adventure for their own gear instead of getting hand-me-
  downs from their alts.
- Items from boss fights and most higher-end adventure items should be set
  bind-on-pickup so that players must earn them for themselves. This is a
  "should" rule rather than a "must" rule, but expect the head builder to
  review your use of bind flags and ask you to justify them. You can also use
  bind-on-pickup to encourage players to do adventures for themselves, even at
  low levels.
- Only reasonably small or simple weapons should have the HOLD wear flag (in
  addition to WIELD). We don't let players wield two huge axes.
- Even if a weapon normally takes two hands to wield, don't set the TWO-
  HANDED flag unless you want it to be a big big weapon. This flag requires an
  ability that is only available at level 100, to certain classes.
- Storage is only used for resources and common items. Scalable and enchanted
  items will never be storable in normal storage. You don't have to set any
  storage locations for an item to be stored in "warehouse storage".
- If an item is used as a building resource, you should give it custom messages
  for build-to-char and build-to-room.
- All lights must have a timer. If you want a player to activate a light before
  it starts timing down, make an unlit version with a LIGHT interaction.
- The COMBINE interaction should always use 1 exclusion set, as it will extract
  the original item if the interaction succeeds, and it's usually not safe to
  run additional interactions.

Quests (QEDIT):
- You can create more complex quests by chaining simple quests.
- The VISIT-* task types do not work as prereqs; only as tasks.
- For low-level quests, reward order may matter. Give skill exp/levels BEFORE
  reward items, as the scale level may go up.
- If you use the QUEST-CHAIN reward type, put it last. It will look better
  at the end.
- If you set REPEAT-PER-INSTANCE, you should almost always also set the
  EXPIRES-AFTER-INSTANCE flag. This way, the player will always have a version
  from their current instance.
- When you use REPEAT-PER-INSTANCE, the COMPLETED-QUEST and NOT-COMPLETED tasks
  will only count quests that were/not completed in the same instance. This
  allows you to create complex chains or mutually-exclusive quests that reset
  with each new instance.
- The REPEAT-PER-INSTANCE feature can be somewhat muddled if players start a
  new instance without finishing the previous one, as the game is not designed
  for this scenario and they player may end up with a mixture of quests from
  the two instances. If you have a good solution for this problem, suggest it
  to Paul (paul@empiremud.net). The current advice is to not worry about it and
  hope players don't get themselves into these confusing situations.
- Daily quests automatically repeat once per 'daily cycle' if their 'repeat' is
  set to never/immediately. You can also set longer repeat timers on them; they
  will still count toward the daily limit but respect the long repeat time.
- Empire-only quests will also match "not in an empire" if the mob/room and
  player are both in no empire.
- Empire-only quests have no effect if the start/end point is an object.
- If multiple DAILY quests share the same 'daily cycle', only one of them is
  available per day. Any unique integer can be a daily cycle, but for the sake
  of cleanliness, you should pick the vnum of one of the quests on the cycle.
- For tasks and prerequisites, any requirements you add are "OR" by default
  (any matching requirement from the list lets the character pass the check).
  If you want them to be "AND" requirements, you need to set a group letter on
  them.

Room Templates (REDIT):
- Don't confuse room templates with the designated rooms that players can add
  to their buildings; those are made in the building editor. Room templates are
  only for adventure zones.
- If your rooms are DARK (or OUTDOOR but not LIGHT), you should consider giving
  your mobs INFRA.
- You can use "random" direction exits to make an adventure's layout change
  from instance to instance.
- If your adventure is set on a ship, you can use the port/starboard/fore/aft
  directions. Actually, you can use them even if it's not, but that might be
  silly.
- If you use the ROTATABLE flag on your adventure itself, the directions of
  your exits can be rotated so the zone has the same shape, but a different
  orientation in each instance. Random exits aren't really affected by this.
  Ship directions like "starboard" are also not affected by this, as starboard
  is the same direction no matter which way a ship faces.

Sectors (SECTEDIT):
- The IS-ADVENTURE, MAP-BUILDING, and INSIDE-ROOM flags are for very specific
  special use, and shouldn't be used on new sectors. However, they won't really
  do anything.
- Please provide a useful list of commands for any new sector. For example, if
  you add any DIG interaction, put "dig" on the commands list.

Skills (SKILLEDIT):
- See HELP ABILITY POINTS for a breakdown of how many points a player gets in
  each skill tree. Use this to "gate" abilities and prevent players from having
  too many powerful abilities at once.
- Remember that players can only level up an ability from the level you assign
  it to, to the cap for that level range (50, 75, 100). You need to provide
  several abilities at the 50 and 75 marks so that players can level past these
  points.
- An ability assigned at level 50 can be purchased by someone who does not
  specialize past 50. If they choose to specialize, that ability can be used to
  level the skill from there.
- The skill description should be short (40-50 characters), written like a
  sentence, and with no punctuation. It is displayed on the "skills" command.
- Abilities can be on more than one class and more than one role within a class
  but you CANNOT assign an ability to both a class and a skill -- it would
  count toward purchased abilities in that skill tree.

Socials (SOCEDIT):
- Players must meet all the requirements for a social to use it.
- If a player types a social that has multiple versions, they get the one that
  has the most requirements. If they qualify for more than one same-named
  social with the same number of requirements, one is chosen at random.

Triggers and Scripts (TRIGEDIT):
- Scripts must be formatted with /f -- this will also ensure your if/end and
  while/done tags all match.
- Each time you change a script's "types", it will reset its percent or other
  type-specific fields. Those fields also won't appear until types are set.
- If your script is confusing, please add comments to it (using *).
- If a mob or room trigger uses scaled commands like %damage% or %aoe%, you
  should ensure that it's used in an adventure zone with a LOCK-LEVEL flag,
  otherwise the game may not be able to determine a scaled level. Objects that
  were dropped as loot by mobs should also already have scaled levels. Mob
  scripts also almost always have a valid scaled level, even if if not in a
  level-locked adventure zone.
- Adventure zone scripts that use mgoto (or any room-targeting commands) must
  use room targets like i1234 to target by room template vnum instead of live
  room vnum. This will cause it to go to the current instance's version of a
  room template. It only works for room templates in the same adventure zone.
- If a script loads an object or mob, and it's not in a level-locked adventure
  zone, the script may also need to scale the obj's/mob's level itself.
- Do not put a "%quest% finish" in a trigger that's attached to an object
  that requires that quest. The object will be extracted during the "finish"
  and it will interrupt the execution of your trigger.

Vehicles (VEDIT):
- Keywords should always have the most significant word first (the noun). This
  keyword is preserved when the vehicle is renamed.
- Only set an icon on a vehicle if it should be visible on the map; in most
  cases you should leave this blank.
- Vehicles only have an interior (are boardable) if the "interior room"
  property is set.
- The IN flag will modify the SIT flag, and will also change how the vehicle
  appears when you're inside it.
- The movement flags (DRIVING, SAILING, FLYING) only matter when combined with
  LEADABLE or an interior room. Otherwise there is no way to move the vehicle.
- The DRAGABLE flag always allows a vehicle to be dragged on land, never any
  other terrain.
- A vehicle is effectively a chair if it has SIT but no movement flags.
- Vehicles take 10% health damage each year ONLY if they require yearly
  maintenance (or are incomplete). A vehicle with only 1 hitpoint won't last
  long.
- When a vehicle takes at least 10% of its max hitpoints in damage, it will
  also add 1 year's maintenance to its repair needs. If it has no yearly
  maintenance set, it will add a "pouch of nails" instead.
- If a vehicle takes damage that's less than 10% of its hitpoints, it still
  needs repair but doesn't require any additional resources.
#d
"OLC LEVELS" "OLC SCALING" "OLC SCALE"

There are several ways you can set levels for things, and level will cascade
from Adventure to Mob to Object.

When the game scales an object, it checks the level limits on the object itself
first. If either the min or max are 0, they will inherit the min or max from
the adventure they are in.

An object is scaled to the level of the mob who dropped it as loot, or who
loaded it, so the object's level may also be limited by the mob's level if the
object doesn't have its own level limits. Remember that mobs aren't usually
scaled until combat begins, but they can be pre-scaled by the adventure flags
LOCK-LEVEL-ON-ENTER or LOCK-LEVEL-ON-COMBAT if you need the mob scaled without
combat.

When a mob scales, it also first checks its own min/max scale levels, and if
it doesn't have its own min or max, it will inherit one from the adventure it
is in.

ABILEDIT "OLC ABILITIES" "OLC ABILITY" "ABILITY EDITOR"

Usage:  .abil <command>
        .command

The .olc ability editor allows you to configure the data for various abilities.
The main properties set up here are names and mastery abilities.

All commands in the editor arg highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these commands by typing &yHELP ABILEDIT <COMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
> .abil edit 123
> .name Test Ability
> .save

#d
"ABILEDIT FLAGS" "ABILITY FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following ability flags are available:
 * - There are noflags for abilities yet
#d
"ABILEDIT MASTERYABILITY" "ABILEDIT MASTERY ABILITY"

Usage:  .masterability <ability>

The mastery ability is a separate ability which boosts the performance of this
ability if a player has both. For example, many crafting abilities have linked
mastery abilities that result in the (superior) flag on crafts.

Most abilities have no mastery ability.

See also: OLC ABILITIES
#d
"ABILEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This lets you set an ability's name. Names should have each word capitalized
and should be relatively short.

By convention, active abilities (ones with their own commands) almost always
have the same name one-word name as the command they will use.

When a player types an ability name (e.g. to buy the ability), the game looks
for exact matches first and then tries a multi-abbreviation approach, where
each word typed by the user is matched sequentially. For example, "hor fo"
matches "Horrid Form".

See also: OLC ABILITIES
#d
"ADVEDIT AUTHOR"

Usage:  .author <name>

This allows you to set the name of the author of the zone, which is used to
give credit to the original builder.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT CASCADE" "ADVEDIT UNCASCADE" CASCADE UNCASCADE

Usage:  .adv cascade <adventure vnum>
        .adv uncascade <adventure vnum>

The cascade command will apply the adventure's min/max levels to all the mobs
and objects in the adventure that don't already have their own min/max. This
command will ignore any mob/item that already has either a min or max level.

The uncascade command removes the min/max level from all mobs and objects whose
min/max are identical to the adventure's own settings.

Both commands ignore objects that don't have the SCALABLE flag.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

The adventure description is shown to players who request information about the
adventure.

The description is set in the string editor. You should use /fi to format it
with indent inside the string editor.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, STRING EDITOR
#d
"ADVEDIT ENDVNUM" "ADVEDIT END VNUM" "ADVEDIT STARTVNUM" "ADVEDIT START VNUM"

Usage:  .startvnum <vnum>
        .endvnum <vnum>

The vnum range determines which room templates are loaded when the instance is
instantiated. All rooms in the adventure must fall within this vnum range.

Only high-level immortals can edit the vnums of an adventure. Lower-level imms
may edit other properties of their own adventures.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT FLAGS" "ADVENTURE FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following adventure flags are available:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - The adventure will not be instantiated in the world.
 LOCK-LEVEL-ON-ENTER - Instance level locks when a player enters.
 LOCK-LEVEL-ON-COMBAT - Instance level locks when a player fights.
 !NEARBY - Instances do not show up when players type nearby.
 ROTATABLE - Each instance will have a random orientation (whole zone rotates).
 CONFUSING-RANDOMS - The instancer will not logically match random exits.
 !NEWBIE - Will not spawn on newbie islands.
 NEWBIE-ONLY - Only spawns on newbie islands.
 NO-MOB-CLEANUP - Won't despawn mobs that got out of the instance on cleanup.
 EMPTY-RESET-ONLY - Won't reset while players are inside.

#d
"ADVEDIT LIMIT" "INSTANCE LIMIT"

Usage:  .limit <number>

This number controls how many copies of an adventure can exist in the world
at a time.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINK BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINKING BDG-EXISTING"

Usage:  .linking add BDG-EXISTING <building vnum> <dir> [flags]

This adds an exit, in the direction of your choice (or "random"), to an exist-
ing building in the world. If you don't set the CLAIMED-OK flag, it will only
target unclaimed buildings, which may be rarer depending on player behavior.

CAUTION: this will NOT work well with "open"-style buildings, such as
fountains, because they can't have normal exits. If you want to connect an
adventure to an open building, use PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING instead.

"ADVEDIT BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINK BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINKING BDG-NEW"

Usage:  .linking add BDG-NEW <building vnum> <dir> "<build on>" ["build facing"] [flags]

This will construct a new building somewhere in the world. The direction you
specify will be the direction of the exit from the building into the adventure
zone. The building may face a random direction.

You must specify flags for what type of terrain it can be built upon. In most
cases, you must also specify the type(s) of terrain it must be built facing.
Both of these are the same as the "buildon" and "buildfacing" flags from the
craft and sector editors; see &yHELP SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS&0.

CAUTION: If you use this with an "open" building such as a fountain, there will
be no entrance to the interior templated rooms. This is usually undesirable
(use PORTAL-BDG-NEW instead), but it can also be used to create map-only
adventures.

CAUTION: You must not use designated rooms (or any "building" with the ROOM
flag) for this, because they can't be built on the map.

#d
"ADVEDIT NOT-NEAR-SELF" "ADVEDIT LINK NOT-NEAR-SELF" "ADVEDIT LINKING NOT-NEAR-SELF"

Usage:  .linking add NOT-NEAR-SELF <distance>

This linking rule limits all other rules based on distance. You can use it to
keep the same adventure from spawning two copies in close proximity.

All distances are measured in map tiles. Setting a NOT-NEAR-SELF of 50 would
mean no two copies of the adventure will link within 50 tiles of each other.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING
#d
"ADVEDIT PORTAL-WORLD" "ADVEDIT LINK PORTAL-WORLD" "ADVEDIT LINKING PORTAL-WORLD"

Usage:  .linking add PORTAL-WORLD <sector vnum> <portal-in vnum> <portal-out vnum> [flags]

This will spawn a portal somewhere in the world, matching the sector of your
choice. You must provide portal object vnums for the in- and out-portals, but
it is okay if both are the same.

Remember that the portals don't have to be called portals. You could use "a
strange door in the side of the tree", and the messages would look correct
when players type "enter door" or "enter tree".

CAUTION: if you choose a sector like "Building", the portal will be able to
spawn in any building. You should NEVER use the "Adventure Room" sector, as
spawning an adventure inside of random adventures will have strange side-
effects, such as trapping players in the 2nd adventure.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINK PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING" "ADVEDIT LINKING PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING"

Usage:  .linking add PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING <building vnum> <portal-in vnum> <portal-out vnum> [flags]

This will spawn a portal in a random building (or designated room) matching the
vnum you set here. You must provide portal object vnums for the in- and out-
portals, but it is okay if both are the same.

Remember that the portals don't have to be called portals. You could use "a
trapdoor in the floor", and the messages would look correct when players type
"enter trapdoor".

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT PORTAL-BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINK PORTAL-BDG-NEW" "ADVEDIT LINKING PORTAL-BDG-NEW"

Usage:  .linking add PORTAL-BDG-NEW <building vnum> <portal-in vnum> <portal-out vnum> "<build on>" "[build facing]" [flags]

This will first create a building on the map, and then spawn a portal inside
it. You must provide portal object vnums for the in- and out-portals, but it
is okay if both are the same.

You must specify flags for what type of terrain it can be built upon. In most
cases, you must also specify the type(s) of terrain it must be built facing.
Both of these are the same as the "buildon" and "buildfacing" flags from the
craft and sector editors; see &yHELP SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS&0.

Remember that the portals don't have to be called portals. You could use "a
trapdoor in the floor", and the messages would look correct when players type
"enter trapdoor".

CAUTION: You must not use designated rooms (or any "building" with the ROOM
flag) for this, because they can't be built on the map.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT TIME-LIMIT" "ADVEDIT LINK TIME-LIMIT" "ADVEDIT LINKING TIME-LIMIT"

Usage:  .linking add TIME-LIMIT <minutes> [flags]

This linking option allows you to force the adventure to de-spawn after a
certain amount of time. You can also despawn an adventure early using the
%adventurecomplete% command in a script.

Adventures will never de-spawn while players are still inside.

Adventures should ALMOST ALWAYS have this option set. If they can spawn on
claimed land, it is required, in order to ensure the adventure eventually
de-spawns.

See also: ADVEDIT LINKING, %ADVENTURECOMPLETE%
#d
"ADVEDIT LINKING" "ADVEDIT LINK RULE" "LINKING RULES" "LINK RULES"

Usage: linking add <type> <data> [flags]
       linking change <number> <field> <value>
       linking remove <number | all>

Linking rules help the game engine determine where to link instances of an
adventure. You can add as many linking rules as you like; it will spawn
instances in any place that matches any rule.

See specific help files for each type: &yHELP ADVEDIT <TYPE>&0
 BDG-EXISTING: Link from an existing building or interior room.
 BDG-NEW: Builds the building on the map and links from it (no interior rooms).
 PORTAL-WORLD: Portal appears in a matching sector.
 PORTAL-BDG-EXISTING: Portal appears in an existing building or interior room.
 PORTAL-BDG-NEW: Builds the building on the map and puts a portal in it (no
    interior rooms).
 TIME-LIMIT: Removes instances after a certain number of minutes expire.
 NOT-NEAR-SELF: Prevent the adventure from linking near other copies of itself.

Available flags:
 CLAIMED-OK - Can link to claimed locations (default: unclaimed only).
 CITY-ONLY - Only links to claimed tiles in cities.
 !CITY - Will not link to claimed tiles in cities.

Portals require a portal object for both the entrance and exit (they may be
the same object). Existing buildings may also be interior rooms, but new
building rules require a normal map building (one without the ROOM flag).

For types requiring build-on or build-facing, you should include the set of
build flags in quotes ("plains desert") if you use more than one. For the full
list of build flags, see HELP SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS, VNUM
#d
"ADVEDIT MAXLEVEL" "ADVEDIT MAX LEVEL" "ADVEDIT MINLEVEL" "ADVEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <number>
        .minlevel <number>

These settings control the minimum and maximum levels for an adventure zone.
These are set in terms of players' composite level (the level number given by
their skills and gear).

Adventures whose minimum level is over 25 will not spawn on newbie islands.

The OLC LEVELS help file has additional notes on how to choose levels.

You can use the 'cascade' editor command to copy levels from the adventure to
its mobs and objects.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, OLC LEVELS, ADVEDIT CASCADE
#d
"ADVEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This lets you set the name of the adventure. The names should be reasonably
short (less than 1 line) and concise. Usually, these are written in title case
(the first letter of each word is uppercase).

Example names:
 > Magiterranean: The Grove
 > Ruins: Bandit Camp

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT PLAYERLIMIT" "ADVEDIT PLAYER LIMIT"

Usage:  .playerlimit <number>

This allows you to restrict the number of players who may be inside an
adventure at one time.

Setting it to 0 means no-limit. The maximum group size is 4, so that is a safe
limit on most adventures.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d
"ADVEDIT RESET" "ADVEDIT RESET TIME" "ADVEDIT RESETTIME"

Usage:  .reset <minutes>

This sets the time between adventure zone resets. Each time the zone resets,
it may spawn more mobs and objects.

You may set a reset time of 0 if the adventure should never reset once it has
been instantiated.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES
#d

ARCHEDIT "OLC ARCHETYPES" "ARCHETYPE OLC" "ARCHETYPE EDITOR"

Usage:  .arch <command>
        .<command>

The .olc archetype editor is a powerful tool for creating and editing player
archetypes (character creation options). It provides a simple in-game menu with
contextual choices to design any archetype.

All commands in the editor are highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these by typing &yHELP ARCHEDIT <COMMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
 > .arch edit 99
 > .name Silent Assassin
 > .skill add Stealth 30
 > .save

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

#d
"ARCHEDIT ATTRIBUTES"

Usage:  .attribute <type> <number>
        .attribute <copy> <archetype vnum>

Each of a player's archetypes adds to their attributes. By design, the
starting attributes should be low. Players will earn higher attributes using
gear and abilities.

An attribute can be positive, negative, or zero. Players will get the sum of
the attributes from all their archetypes (with guaranteed minimum levels, if
they end up too low).

All of the stock Origin archetypes have starting attributes totalling 11 (one
at 3, two at 1, and the rest at 2).

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
"ARCHEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description <text>

The archetype description should be a short phrase that indicates what type
of character it is meant for. Descriptions should not be longer than about
half a line of text.

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
"ARCHEDIT FEMALERANK" "ARCHEDIT FEMALE RANK" "ARCHEDIT MALERANK" "ARCHEDIT MALE RANK"

Usage:  .femalerank <name>
        .malerank <name>

These set the default rank when a player of this archetype founds an empire.
Two rank names are available in case the name is gender-specific (Lord, Lady).
However, it's also ok to set the same name for both.

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
"ARCHEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Archetype flags are properties that affect how the archetype behaves.

Available flags:
 IN-DEV - Cannot be chosen or displayed.
 BASIC - Shows up in the basic set of archetypes (others must be searched).

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
"ARCHEDIT GEAR" "GEDIT GEAR"

Usage:  .gear add <slot | inventory> <vnum>
        .gear copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .gear change <number> <slot | vnum> <new value>
        .gear remove <number>

Archetypes: Sets the starting gear for players who choose this archetype. You
should provide some low-level gear (it will be scaled to level 1, or to the
item's minimum scale level).

Global Newbie Gear: Gear given to all new players, if their archetype didn't
fill the slot.

Usually, the following slots have newbie gear: head, clothes, legs, feet,
wield, hold.

The hold slot is generally a light, e.g. the newbie torch (2104).

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES, OLC GLOBALS, GEDIT TYPE
#d
"ARCHEDIT LORE"

Usage:  .lore <text | none>

Archetype lore is the lore given to a player who starts the game with this
archetype. It's optional -- if it's set to none, the player will get no lore
at all from it.

Lore is always the first part of a sentence that will end with "on Month Day,
Year." It should end with no punctuation.

You can use the following tokens in lore:
 $e - he/she
 $s - his/her
 $m - him/her

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
"ARCHEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The archetype name is the text displayed to the player, and used to choose an
archetype. The name should be reasonably short, and title-cased (Each Word
Capitalized).

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
"ARCHEDIT STARTINGSKILLS" "ARCHEDIT STARTING SKILLS"

Usage:  .startingskill <add | change> <name> <level>
        .startingskill remove <name>

Archetypes determine a player's starting skill levels. Players should begin
the game with a small number of skill points split between one or two skills.
However, the system is flexible and you may choose to give a small number of
points to all skills.

All of the stock archetypes have a total of 30 skill points, usually split
between two skills as 20/10.

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
"ARCHEDIT TYPE"

Usage:  .type <type>

Archetype types sort them into categories. During creation, a player picks one
from each category. EmpireMUDs may add or remove archetype types, for example
to add races or cultures.

Available types:
 ORIGIN - A character's background and upbringing.
 HOBBY - Some bonus skill points.

See also: OLC ARCHETYPES
#d
AUGEDIT "OLC AUGMENTS" "AUGMENT OLC" "AUGMENT EDITOR"

Usage:  .aug <command>
        .<command>

The .olc augment editor is a powerful tool for creating and editing augments
(which are like item enchantments). It provides a simple in-game menu with
contextual choices to design multiple types of augments.

All commands in the editor are highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these by typing &yHELP AUGEDIT <COMMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
 > .aug edit 11000
 > .name moar power
 > .type enchantment
 > .save

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

See also: OLC, OLC ABORT, OLC EDIT, OLC EDITOR, OLC SAVE
#d
"AUGEDIT APPLY" "AUGEDIT APPLIES"

Usage:  .apply add <value> <apply>
        .apply change <number> <value | apply> <new value>
        .apply remove <number | all>

Applies are the specific bonuses that will be added to an item when it is
enhanced with this augment. The values you provide for the applies are actually
"weights", as the final value is determined by the level of the augmented item
and the level of the person who augmented it.

If you set applies like "2 to STRENGTH, 1 to DEXTERITY", it means 2/3 of the
points go to the STRENGTH apply and 1/3 to the DEXTERITY apply. If this is used
on an item that receives 6 points from the augment, the final values would come
out to +4 Strength and +2 Dexterity.

You can see a list of applies on HELP APPLIES.

See also: APPLIES, OLC AUGMENTS
#d
"AUGEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Augment flags are properties that affect how the augment behaves.

Available flags:
 IN-DEV - Cannot be used by mortals.
 SELF-ONLY - Can only be used on own items; will bind items to self.
 ARMOR - Works on any ARMOR-type item only.
 SHIELD - Works on any SHIELD-type item only.

See also: OLC AUGMENTS
#d
"AUGEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The augment name is the text used by the player when enchanting (or otherwise
modifying) an item. The name should be all lowercase, and should be fairly
simple.

For example, if an enchantment augment is named "striking", the player will
use it by typing "enchant sword striking".

See also: OLC AUGMENTS
#d
"AUGEDIT REQUIRESABILITY" "AUGEDIT REQUIRES ABILITY"

Usage:  .requiresability <name | none>

This allows you to require the player to have a certain ability in order to
apply this augment. Setting it to 'none' removes this requirement.

See also: OLC AUGMENTS
#d
"AUGEDIT REQUIRESOBJECT" "AUGEDIT REQUIRES OBJECT"

Usage:  .requiresobject <vnum>

Instead of (or in addition to) requiring an ability to use an augment, you
can make it dependent upon having a certain item in the player's inventory.
The player will not see the augment in his list (for example, when he types
enchant) if he doesn't have the item.

The required object will not be consumed unless it is also in the resource
list. An example non-consumable augment might require a spellbook object, so
the effect is that having the spellbook allows the player to enchant weapons
with extra mana.  An example consumable augment might be a grindstone that
lets a player "hone" a sword with additional to-hit.

See also: OLC AUGMENTS, VNUM
#d
"AUGEDIT RESOURCES"

Usage:  .resource add <type> <amount> <vnum/name> [flags, for components only]
        .resource change <number> <quantity | vnum | name | flags> <value>
        .resource remove <number | all>
        .resource move <number> <up | down>

This command sets the resources required to apply the augment to an item.

See HELP OLC RESOURCES for more information.

See also: OLC AUGMENTS
#d
"AUGEDIT TYPE" "AUGMENT TYPES"

Usage:  .type <type>

The augment type determines which command is used to apply the augment to an
item. It also determines what type of "apply" is added to the item, and what
rules those applies will follow. For example, "enchantment" applies can be
removed with the Disenchant ability, but "hone" applies cannot.

Type notes:
 Enchantment - Also sets the ENCHANTED bit on items.
 Hone - Always acts as if it has the SELF-ONLY flag.

See also: OLC AUGMENTS
#d
"AUGEDIT WEAR" "AUGMENT WEAR FLAGS"

Usage:  .wear [add | remove] <wear flags>

The "wear" flags on an augment help determine what kind of item can be a valid
target for the augment. For example, an augment with the WIELD setting can only
be used on items that can be wielded (i.e. weapons).

An augment with no "wear" setting can generally not be used. An augment with
the TAKE wear flag could be used on virtually any item.

Usually an augment should be locked down to just one wear flag.

See also: OEDIT WEAR, OLC AUGMENTS
#d
"BEDIT AFFECTS" "REDIT AFFECTS"

Usage:  .affects [add | remove] <flags>

Each building (or room template) type may have a default set of room affect
flags. These are added to the building tile when built, or are present on a
room that is instantiated from a room template.

Available affects:
 DARK - magically dark and the map tile shows as blank
 SILENT - magically quiet
 CHAMELEON - at distance, appears as the tile it was built upon
 !EVOLVE - will not grow trees or process other evolutions
 !FLY - flying characters cannot enter, like an enchanted wall
 !WEATHER - suppress weather messages and command
 !DISREPAIR - never falls into disrepair (caution: this prevents empire decay)
 !TELEPORT - cannot teleport here

Some affects are managed by live data and commands (do not set affects with *):
 *HAS-INSTANCE - an adventure is linked here
 *TEMPORARY - will be removed when instance is cleaned up
 *UNCLAIMABLE - cannot be claimed
 *PUBLIC - can be used by empires other than the owner
 *DISMANTLING - someone started dismantling it
 *IN-VEHICLE - room is part of the interior of a vehicle
 *!WORK - workforce ignores the room
 *!DISMANTLE - cannot be dismantled until nodismantle is toggled
 *INCOMPLETE - building is unfinished

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, OLC ROOM TEMPLATES
#d
"BEDIT ARTISAN"

Usage:  .artisan <mob vnum>
        .artisan none

Some buildings may have artisan mobs set. These mobs will always spawn in the
building if the building is owned by an empire and has been populated. Only
one artisan will ever spawn per building.

This artisan is marked as an EMPIRE mob and you may use the following name
tokens on the mob itself, if it is only loaded as an artisan:
 #n - randomly chosen first name
 #e - name of the empire it belongs to
 #a - the adjective form of its empire's name

You can use the "none" argument to this command in order to remove the artisan.

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, MEDIT NAMESET, VNUM
#d
"BEDIT CITIZENS"

Usage:  .citizens <number>

This sets how many citizens will move into the base room of the building. It
does not affect any designated/extra rooms. Once populated, these citizens
spawn in the building tile when players are nearby. They can also perform
Workforce chores near their home building.

You cannot control which citizen mobs actually spawn, only how many may live
here total. If the building supports extra rooms, more citizens can be added
in bedrooms.

NOTE: Any building that allows at least 1 citizen may also be set as a player's
private home.

See also: BEDIT ROOMS, HOME, OLC BUILDINGS, WORKFORCE
#d
"BEDIT COMMANDS"

Usage:  .commands <list>
        .commands none

Buildings that allow specific commands should list those commands to help
players. If you set a commands list, it will appear below the room description
(for closed buildings) or below the map (for open buildings).

If this is a storage building, you should always include inventory, retrieve,
and store. If you set the DRINK flag, you should add drink and fill. Consider
all the special tasks a player might perform here.

We generally keep the commands list in alphabetic order with commas between
the commands, and do not put the word "and" before the last entry.

Example:
 > .commands chop, dig, gather, pick

See also: BEDIT FLAGS, OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

All buildings need a good description (except ones flagged OPEN). The
description should be at least 3 full lines, and should always be formatted
with the /fi option in the string editor. Generally descriptions should not
run more than about 6 lines.

The room description is shown when the building is complete (or, it is always
shown if the building is flagged CLOSED). 

See also: BEDIT FLAGS, OLC BUILDINGS, STRING EDITOR
#d
"BEDIT DESIGNATE" "DESIGNATE FLAGS"

Usage:  .designate [add | remove] <flags>

Designate flags control what types of rooms may be added to a building. This
only matters if the "extra rooms" property is set greater than 0.

Rooms can be designated in buildings that have a matching designate flag with
the room. Rooms with no designate flags can't be designated at all (these may
be used for other internal functions).

Available designate flags:
 CRYPT - can designate the crypt
 VAULT - may designate a vault
 FORGE - may designate a forge
 TUNNEL - may designate the tunnel room (for underground/mountain houses)
 HALL - may designate hallways
 SKYBRIDGE - may designate the skybridge room (for treehouses)
 THRONE - may designate a throne room

 HOUSEHOLD - may designate bedroom, study, sitting room, closet, storage, etc
 HAVEN - vampire havens
 SHIP-MAIN - core ship rooms
 SHIP-LARGE - rooms for larger ships
 SHIP-EXTRA - bonus rooms for huge ships
 LAND-VEHICLE - rooms for land vehicles like wagons

See also: OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT FAME"

Usage:  .fame <amount>

This number is added to an empire's fame for each instance of this building
they own.

You can set negative fame to penalize empires for certain buildings.

Most buildings should have 0 fame, unless they are monuments.

See also: OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

When set on a building, these flags affect all interior rooms, too. When set
on a designate-able room (a building where the ROOM flag is set), they only
affect players in that room.

(Some former building flags were moved to the 'functions' list, and their
former building flags still show up in the editor as DEPRECATED.)

Available flags:
 ROOM - this is a room that can be added with the designate command if it has
    matching designate flags with a building
 ALLOW-MOUNTS - players can ride inside without dismounting
 TWO-ENTRANCES - the building will have a rear entrance across from the main
    entrance (does not apply to OPEN buildings)
 OPEN - never takes the player off the map, shows no room description, and
    cannot have interior rooms
 CLOSED - always shows the room description and takes the player off the map,
    even if the building is not complete
 INTERLINK - can be interlinked with other nearby INTERLINK buildings
 HERD - mobs can be herded into this building
 DEDICATE - can be dedicated to a patron god or player, which adds "of Name"
    to the room title
 !RUINS - building leaves no ruins when it decays
 !NPC - mobs won't enter this building
 BARRIER - can only go back the way you came, unless flying
 IN-CITY-ONLY - can only be used if in an established city
 LARGE-CITY-RADIUS - counts as in-city much further away than normal
 ATTACH-ROAD - on the ascii map, roads attach to this tile like it's a road
 BURNABLE - will catch fire if a fire is placed inside by a hostile empire
 SAIL - can enter this building with a boat
 ITEM-LIMIT - only a certain number of items can be dropped here
 LONG-AUTOSTORE - autostore takes 72 hours instead of 3 here
 HIGH-DEPLETION - has more resources than a normal tile
 !DELETE - will not be deleted for not having a homeroom
 NEED-BOAT - requires a boat, flying, or swimming to enter
 LOOK-OUT - can see the map using "look out"
 2ND-TERRITORY - counts as territory off the map (e.g. in a ship)
 UPGRADED - modifies other building types like SHIPYARD

* Note: If you change the LARGE-CITY-RADIUS flag on existing buildings,
        territory counts will not update right away. Any empire can force a
        re-count by claiming or abandoning any tile.

"BEDIT HITPOINTS" "BEDIT HEALTH"

Usage:  .hitpoints <value>

This number is how much damage a building can take from a catapult or siege
ritual before it is destroyed. Buildings with the ROOM flag do not need this.

Catapults deal 8 damage per 100 levels, per shot. Siege rituals deal
Intelligence + 1 damage. You can determine how many hitpoints to give a
building based on this.

If a building takes more than 10% of its hitpoints in damage from an attack,
it will also need its yearly maintenance resources to be fixed.

Common hitpoint levels:
 house: 8-24
 wall: 32
 castle: 64
 mountain building: 128
 adventure: 1000 (to discourage sieging)

See also: BEDIT YEARLY MAINTENANCE, FIRE, OLC BUILDINGS, SIEGE RITUAL
#d
"BEDIT ICON"

Usage:  .icon <icon>

The icon is how a building appears on the world map. It must always be exactly
4 characters long, not counting any color codes.

Buildings usually use icons like: [  ], (  ), {  }
Usually the symbols inside the parentheses or braces are a pair of letters that
loosely indicate what building it is, but you should try not to duplicate
existing buildings.

If you don't start with a color code, the building will have a color based on
the tile it was built upon (and the season). In addition to normal color codes, 
you can use &&? to represent the base tile's color if you need to use it later
in the color code. If you want to use the && symbol in the icon, you must
double it (&&&&).

There is no need to put a &&0 at the end of the icon.

See additional info at HELP SPECIAL ICONS.

Examples:
 > .icon &&0[--]
 > .icon .&&0[]&&?.

#d
"BEDIT MILITARY"

Usage:  .military <number>

This property adds to the military total of the empire that owns it. However,
the military value of an empire is not used for anything at the moment.

See also:  OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The 'name' property is used by some commands like 'territory' and 'vnum' to
search for buildings, so it should be reasonably unique. It's also shown as
the short form of a building in some sentences.

You should choose a name that's as short as possible. For example, if your
room title is "A Foul-Smelling Outhouse", the name should be "Outhouse".

See also: BEDIT TITLE, OLC BUILDINGS, TERRITORY, VNUM
#d
"BEDIT RESOURCES" "BEDIT YEARLY MAINTENANCE"

Usage:  .resource add <type> <amount> <vnum/name> [flags, for components only]
        .resource change <number> <quantity | vnum | name | flags> <value>
        .resource remove <number | all>
        .resource move <number> <up | down>

This command adds materials to the building's "yearly maintenance" list. These
are resources needed to maintain the building each year. If you don't set any,
then the building does not require maintenance.

This uses the ".resource" command to be consistent with other editors, but
these are not the resources needed to build the vehicle in the first place --
only to repair it.

If a building takes damage from any source, and that damage is more than 10% of
its hitpoints, it will also add the yearly-maintenance resources to the repair
cost.

Buildings with only 1 hitpoint will never get their yearly maintenance cost, as
even 1 year of decay will destroy them.

Note: Interior rooms do not normally require any yearly maintenance and don't
take damage.

See HELP OLC RESOURCES for more information.

See also: BEDIT HITPOINTS, OLC BUILDINGS, MAINTAIN, RESOURCE ACTIONS
#d
"BEDIT ROOMS" "BEDIT ROOMS" "BEDIT EXTRA ROOMS"

Usage:  .rooms <number>

If this number is greater than 0, players may use the 'designate' command to
add additional rooms to the building, with options based on what you set with
the '.designate' olc option.

NOTE: If players add bedrooms to a building, it will spawn additional citizens.

See also: BEDIT DESIGNATE, OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT SPAWNS" "CROPEDIT SPAWNS" "SECTEDIT SPAWNS"

Usage:  .spawns add <mob vnum> <percent> [flags]
        .spawns copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .spawns change <number> <vnum | percent | flags> <value>
        .spawns remove <number | all>
        .spawns list

This lets you control how mobs spawn in a given location. Mobs only spawn if
there aren't too many other mobs present, and only if they meet the percent
and flag requirements of their spawn info.

You can set any percent between .01 and 100. This is the chance the mob will
be loaded each time the room is checked for spawns, which is usually every few
minutes while players are nearby. Any mob spawned this way will gain the
SPAWNED mob flag and will despawn if no players are nearby.

Setting two flags which are mutually exclusive (e.g. NORTHERN and SOUTHERN)
will result in the mob never spawning. The flags indicate the mob will spawn
ONLY if the condition is met.

Available spawn flags:
 NOCTURNAL - only spawns at night
 DIURNAL - only spawns during the day
 CLAIMED - only spawns if the room/tile is claimed
 UNCLAIMED - only spawns if the room/tile is NOT claimed
 CITY - only spawns if the tile is in-city (and claimed)
 OUT-OF-CITY - only spawns if the tile is not in a city, or is unclaimed
 NORTHERN - only spawns in the northern half of the map
 SOUTHERN - only spawns in the southern half of the map
 EASTERN - only spawns in the eastern half of the map
 WESTERN - only spawns in the western half of the map

Example:
 > .spawns add 12499 3 NOCTURNAL UNCLAIMED
 > .spawns copy sector 12

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, OLC CROPS, OLC SECTORS, VNUM
#d
"BEDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

This sets the room title for the building. It is shown above the room
description or map. The room's title will be colored based on the empire that
owns it, so it's important not to put color codes in the title.

Room titles are usually short, descriptive phrases, with title-case lettering
(Title Case Capitalizes Most Words). They should usually start with "A", "An",
or "The".

Examples:
 The Greatest Building You Never Heard Of
 A Strange House
 The Eye of the World

See also: OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"BEDIT UPGRADESTO" "BEDIT UPGRADES TO"

Usage:  .upgradesto <building vnum>
        .upgradesto none

Some buildings can be upgraded into other buildings. You specify which building
this one can upgrade to here. You must specify a valid building vnum.

In order for the 'upgrade' command to actually work, you must also use the
craft recipe editor to create a new building recipe for the upgraded building,
and mark it as UPGRADE. This building will only need a regular craft recipe,
and only if it's buildable.

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, UPGRADE, VNUM
#d
"CEDIT BUILDFACING" "CEDIT BUILD FACING"

Usage:  .buildfacing [add | remove] <flags>
        .buildfacing generic

This command sets the rules for the tile a building must face. If the building
is an "open" building (one that doesn't take players off the map), it doesn't
require a buildfacing at all. However, if an "open" building has a buildfacing,
the game engine will still require a facing direction when it is built. This
allows you to require that quarries are built next to mountains, for example.

You can also set ".buildfacing generic", which sets a pre-defined list of
buildfacing flags that many buildings are allowed to face.

The following flags are available:
 water - any ocean or river tile
 plains - a plains or a road that was built on plains
 mountain - a mountain or mountain path
 full forest - an overgrown forest (^^^^) or other full forest
 desert - a desert or a road that was built on desert
 river - a river tile
 jungle - any jungle tile
 not player made - can't be (e.g.) a river tile made by a player
 ocean - an ocean tile
 oasis - an oasis tile
 crops - any crop or seeded tile
 grove - a desert grove tile
 swamp - a swamp tile
 any forest - any level of forest tile, from light forest to overgrown
 open building - a building that doesn't block the map

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT BUILDING"

Usage:  .building <type>

This lets you set the actual building or other construction type that the
recipe will build. The list varies depending on the .buildtype you chose.

See also: CEDIT BUILDTYPE, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT BUILDON" "CEDIT BUILD ON"

Usage:  .buildon [add | remove] <flags>

This sets the types of terrain that a building craft may be built upon. You
must set at least one flag.

The following flags are available:
 water - any ocean or river tile
 plains - a plains or a road that was built on plains
 mountain - a mountain or mountain path
 full forest - an overgrown forest (^^^^) or other full forest
 desert - a desert or a road that was built on desert
 river - a river tile
 jungle - any jungle tile
 not player made - can't be (e.g.) a river tile made by a player
 ocean - an ocean tile
 oasis - an oasis tile
 crops - *** do not use for buildon
 grove - a desert grove tile
 swamp - a swamp tile
 any forest - *** do not use for buildon
 open building - *** do not use for buildon

See also: CEDIT BUILDFACING, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT BUILDTYPE" "CEDIT BUILD TYPE"

Usage:  .buildtype <type>

Building craft recipes can be one of three types, and these types will
determine which .building set you can choose from.

Available buildtypes:
 BUILDING - a normal building
 ROAD - a road, bridge, mountain path, etc.
 BARRIER - a fence or wall

See also: CEDIT BUILDING, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT CREATES"

Usage:  .creates <object vnum>

This options sets which object is created by the recipe. This only applies to
recipes which are not soup.

See also: CEDIT QUANTITY, OLC CRAFTS, VNUM
#d
"CEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Flags let you specify certain properties about the craft recipe, like where it
must be performed.

You must leave the IN-DEVELOPMENT flag set until the recipe is ready to go
live, at which point it becomes available to players who have the right skill.

Available flags:
 POTTERY - always requires cooking fire, goes faster at potter's hut
 APIARIES-TECH - requires being inside an empire with Apiaries tech
 GLASS-TECH - requires being inside an empire with Glassblowing tech
 GLASSBLOWER - requires being at an actual glassblower building
 CARPENTER - requires being at a carpenter building
 ALCHEMY - requires cooking fire and glassblowing tech, or alchemist/laboratory
 SHARP-TOOL - requires a sharp tool in the wield slot
 FIRE - requires cooking fire
 SOUP - requires a container of water and creates a liquid instead of an item
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - only immortals can use this recipe
 UPGRADE - for building recipes only, marks this recipe as the cost to upgrade
    to this building type from some other type
 DISMANTLE-ONLY - for building recipes only, this recipe allows the building
    to be dismantled, but not built; it won't show up in the build list
 IN-CITY-ONLY - a craft or building can only be made in a city radius
 VEHICLE - creates a vehicle instead of an item, see CRAFT VEHICLES
 SHIPYARD - requires being at a shipyard
 BLD-UPGRADED - requires being at a building with the UPGRADED flag

See also: CEDIT TYPE, OLC CRAFTS, OLC REMOVEINDEV
#d
"CEDIT LEVELREQUIRED" "CEDIT LEVEL REQUIRED"

Usage:  .levelrequired <level>

This lets you set the crafting level required to make a craft. It works on any
type of craft. This uses the 'Crafting' trait shown on score, and the +CRAFTING
apply from items. Crafting level includes skill level, so a requirement of 100
would only require that the player be skill level 100.

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT LIQUID"

Usage:  .liquid <type>

For soups, the recipe requires a drink container of water and fills that with
a liquid type, rather than creating a new object. This command determines the
liquid type.

See also: CEDIT FLAGS, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This sets the name of the craft recipe. The name used when the player chooses
which recipe to craft, e.g. "craft hammock".

Names should be as short as possible, while still being distinct from other
existing craft recipes.

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT QUANTITY"

Usage:  .quantity <number>

Craft recipes can be set to create more than one of an item by raising the
quantity.

See also: CEDIT CREATES, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT REQUIRESABILITY" "CEDIT REQUIRES ABILITY"

Usage:  .requiresability <ability name | none>

You can use this command to set which ability is required to use a particular
craft recipe. If you don't want it to require an ability any more, use 'none'.

See also: OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT REQUIRESOBJECT" "CEDIT REQUIRES OBJECT"

Usage:  .requiresobject <vnum>

Some craft recipes may require a specific object. If the user doesn't have
the object, the recipe won't show up in the list at all. This essentially
associates the recipe to the object.

Pro tip: Combine requiresobject with no-ability to create a building like a
tent, which can be built as long as you have one in your inventory.

For non-building crafts, the object is not consumed unless it's also on the
list of required resources.

Don't use SCALABLE items as a required object if it will be consumed, because
it won't be scaled back to the same level if it's refunded.

See also: OLC CRAFTS, VNUM
#d
"CEDIT RESOURCES"

Usage:  .resource add <type> <amount> <vnum/name> [flags, for components only]
        .resource change <number> <quantity | vnum | name | flags> <value>
        .resource remove <number | all>
        .resource move <number> <up | down>

This command sets the resources required to make the recipe.

Building recipes will require the resources in the order given here; crafting
recipes will use all resources at once. Dismantled buildings also return half
of the used resources, rounded down.

See HELP OLC RESOURCES for more information.

See also: OLC CRAFTS, RESOURCE ACTIONS
#d
"CEDIT TIME"

Usage:  .time <ticks>

This sets the time (in action ticks) that it takes to create the recipe. One
action tick is 5 real seconds. In some cases, the time is reduced by meeting
certain requirements.

For crafts with the POTTERY flag, they take 1/4 the time if crafted at a
potter's hut.

All crafting times are cut in half for players with the matching mastery
ability.

All crafting times are cut in half if they require a hammer or sharp tool,
and that tool is marked (superior).

See also: CEDIT FLAGS, CEDIT MASTERY, CEDIT TYPE, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT TYPE"

Usage:  .type <type>

The type determines which command is used to craft the item, but not which
ability. Some types also have built-in rules.

Available types are:
 FORGE - requires a hammer and a forge building
 CRAFT
 COOK
 SEW
 MILL - requires mill building, quantity doubled by Master Farmer ability
 BREW - potions
 MIX - poisons
 BUILD - used with the build command
 WEAVE
 WORKFORCE - has specific code interactions, but no player command
 MANUFACTURE - for shipbuilding

Note: The SOUP and VEHICLE craft flags both also modify the recipe.

See also: CEDIT FLAGS, CEDIT REQUIRESABILITY, OLC CRAFTS
#d
"CEDIT VOLUME"

Usage:  .volume <drinks>

For soups, this determines the maximum number of drinks created by the recipe.
It will always be limited by the size of the drink container the player uses
to cook the soup in.

See also: CEDIT FLAGS, OLC CRAFTS
#d
CLASSEDIT "OLC CLASSES" "OLC CLASS"

Usage:  .class <command>
        .command

The .olc class editor allows you to set up player classes. On EmpireMUD, the
players don't begin with classes -- they unlock them by leveling up certain
skills. Classes can have broadly overlapping requirements (but can't be
identical to each other), allowing players with similar sets of skills to end
up in different classes.

All commands in the editor arg highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these commands by typing &yHELP CLASSEDIT <COMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
> .class edit 123
> .abbrev Test
> .save

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

See also: OLC, OLC ABORT, OLC EDIT, OLC EDITOR, OLC SAVE
#d
"CLASSEDIT ABBREVIATION"

Usage:  .abbrev <string>

The class abbreviation is shown on the who list and in other places where a
short name is desired. It must be exactly 4 characters and contain no color
codes.

See also: OLC CLASSES
#d
"CLASSEDIT FLAGS" "CLASS FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Class flags set various properties on classes.

Available flags:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - Will not be assigned to players.

See also: OLC CLASSES, OLC REMOVEINDEV
#d
"CLASSEDIT MAXHEALTH" "CLASSEDIT MAX HEALTH"

Usage:  .maxhealth <amount>

This determines the amount of health a player gets at skill level 100. Remember
that certain abilities will raise this amount, and gear will also add to it.

See also: OLC CLASSES
#d
"CLASSEDIT MAXMANA" "CLASSEDIT MAX MANA"

Usage:  .maxmana <amount>

This determines the amount of mana a player gets at skill level 100. Remember
that certain abilities will raise this amount, and gear will also add to it.

See also: OLC CLASSES
#d
"CLASSEDIT MAXMOVES" "CLASSEDIT MAX MOVES"

Usage:  .maxmoves <amount>

This determines the number of movement points a player gets at skill level 100.
Remember that certain abilities will raise this amount, and gear will also add
to it.

See also: OLC CLASSES
#d
"CLASSEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This sets the name of the class. Names should have their first letters
capitalized and should be reasonably short and concise. You should avoid names
that conflict with other classes.

See also: OLC CLASSES
#d
"CLASSEDIT REQUIRES"

Usage:  .requires <skill> <level>
        .requires remove <skill>

This allows you to set the skill requirements for a class. Players are auto-
matically assigned a class when their skills enter a certain range. You can
set as few or as many skill requirements on a class as you like; the player
will be matched to the class that has the best fit.

You can specify the skill by vnum or name (use "quotation marks" for multi-word
names).

The actual requirement is 24 levels below the value you set -- if you set a
skill requirement to 100, a player will qualify when it hits 76.

All stock EmpireMUD classes specify two skills at level 100, but you have more
flexibility if you want to do something different. For example, you could do
more specialized classes that require two skills at 100 and a third at 75.
If you intend to change the number of skills that a player can raise to 50/75/
100, though, you should consult a programmer.

See also: OLC CLASSES, VNUM
#d
"CLASSEDIT ROLE"

Usage:  .role <role> add <ability>
        .role <role> remove <ability | all>

This command assigns abilities to the class, under each role. If more than one
role will have an ability, you must assign it to each of them. There is no
limit on the number of abilities that can be assigned to each role.

Abilities can be specified by name or vnum.

You should not assign an ability that is also assigned to a skill, because a
player who has the ability from his/her class will also count as having spent
an abilitiy point in the skill tree.

See also: OLC CLASSES, VNUM
#d
COMPONENTS "RESOURCE COMPONENTS" "COMPONENT RESOURCES"

Components are generic categories of objects. This allows recipes to require
a type of object, rather than a specific object. Components can also have flags
that indicate specific properties, like a rare log or a magic feather. An
object should be set as a component if 

If a resource list requires a component with certain flags, an objects must
be of the matching component type and have ALL of those flags. (It's okay if
the object also has additional flags.)

See also: OEDIT COMPONENT, COMPONENT FLAGS
#d
"CRAFT VEHICLES" "VEHICLE CRAFTS"

Crafts with the VEHICLE flag will create a vehicle instead of an item. Vehicles
are constructed over time like buildings, and will appear unfinished in the
room until they are completed.

Vehicle crafts don't use the "quantity" or "time" fields. Otherwise, they
behave like regular crafts.
#d
"CROPEDIT CLIMATE" "SECTEDIT CLIMATE"

Usage:  .climate <type>

Each crop and sector has a climate, and these must match for the crop to be
planted on the sector. Climate also affects certain abilities, such as morphs.
Terrains like generic rivers and mountains may have no climate at all. However,
every crop must be associated with a climate.

See also: OLC CROPS, OLC SECTORS
#d
"CROPEDIT FLAGS" "CROP FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Crop flags determine some various properties about crops.

Available flags:
 REQUIRES-WATER - Can only be planted within 4 tiles of fresh water
 ORCHARD - Uses 'pick' instead of 'harvest', shows the orchard commands list, can be chopped down
 !WILD - Won't spawn in the wild
 NEWBIE-ONLY - Only spawns on newbie islands (can be planted anywhere)
 !NEWBIE - Does not spawn on newbie islands

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"CROPEDIT MAPOUT COLOR" "SECTEDIT MAPOUT COLOR" "MAPOUT COLOR" "MAP OUT COLOR"

Usage:  .mapout <color>

This determines what color pixel the sector or crop has on the graphical map.

See also: OLC CROPS, OLC SECTORS
#d
"CROPEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

A crop's name is a short name, always plural and lower-case, that describes
the crop. It is frequently used to build sentences such as "You start planting
<name> here."

The editor will force the first character of the name to be lower-case.

Examples:
 "apples"
 "olives"
 "gourds"

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"CROPEDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

This is the room title for rooms of this crop type. As with all room titles,
it should be title-cased (Each Word Capitalized), should usually start with
an article like "a" or "an", and should not include any punctuation.

Examples:
 "An Apple Orchard"
 "A Field of Cotton"
 "A Vast Cornfield"

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"CROPEDIT XMIN" "CROPEDIT XMAX" "CROPEDIT YMIN" "CROPEDIT YMAX"

Usage:  .xmin <percent>
        .xmax <percent>
        .ymin <percent>
        .ymax <percent>

These four settings help the MUD determine where a crop can spawn. It spawns
if its x-coordinate is <= xmax or >= xmin, and y-coordinate is <= ymax or >=
ymin.

If the 'min' is less than the 'max', this specifies the area between the two.
If the 'max' is less than the 'min', it instead covers both edges of the map,
but NOT the area between the two.

These numbers range from 0-100 because they are percentages of the current map
width, not absolute values.

You should always make sure you have crops set to cover all parts of the map,
so that the crop-spawning systems can pick a valid crop for any region. It
usually helps to draw yourself a diagram on paper of the regions of the map
covered by the crops.

See also: OLC CROPS
#d
"FACTION SCRIPTING" "SCRIPTING FACTIONS"

Writing scripts using faction gives you the ability to control access to
content using the faction system. You should usually prefer to use the Hated
and Venerated levels, rather than the endcap Despised and Revered levels,
because gaining/losing even 1 reputation point can bump a player out of the
endcaps.

Testing reputation against the mob's faction:
eval test %%actor.has_reputation(%self.allegiance%,Liked)%%
if %!test%
  %send% %actor% You must be Liked by %self.faction_name%!
  return 0
end

You can also cause players to gain/lose reputation with:
nop %actor.gain_reputation(1234,-1)%

You can change the faction of a mob with:
nop %mob.allegiance(1234)%

See also: OLC FACTIONS
#d
FEDIT FACTIONEDIT "OLC FACTIONS" "FACTION EDITOR"

Usage:  .f <command>
        .command

The .olc faction editor allows you to configure the data for factions, which
are groups that NPCs can belong to. Players gain and lose reputation with
factions, and these reputation levels can be used to control access to quests
and adventure content.

All commands in the editor arg highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these commands by typing &yHELP FEDIT <COMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
> .f edit 123
> .name Tree Elves
> .flag REP-FROM-KILLS
> .save

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

See also: OLC, OLC ABORT, OLC EDIT, OLC EDITOR, OLC SAVE
#d
"FEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

A faction's name should be capitalized and short, and should never be a
complete sentence. A leading article like "A" or "The" is optional.

Examples:
> The Elves of West Treeville
> The Goblins of Nachotriste
> MacDdraig, the Whale Dragon

See also: OLC FACTIONS
#d
"FEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

Faction descriptions can be any length (up to 4000 characters), and should
include basic information about the faction. If it isn't immediately obvious
where to find your faction or how to gain/lose reputation with them, you
should also include this information.

Players only see faction descriptions if they use the 'faction' command.

See also: FACTION, OLC FACTIONS, STRING EDITOR
#d
"FEDIT FLAGS" "FACTION FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following faction flags are available:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - The faction can't be seen by players, and won't gain rep.
 REP-FROM-KILLS - Players can gain/lose rep by killing faction mobs.

See also: OLC FACTIONS, OLC REMOVEINDEV, RELATIONSHIP FLAGS
#d
"FEDIT MATCHRELATIONS" "FEDIT MAXRELATIONSHIPS" "FEDIT MATCH RELATIONS" "FEDIT MATCH RELATIONSHIPS"

Usage:  .matchrelations

This will synchronize relationships between this faction and other factions,
and will add any relations that are missing. It will not, however, remove any
relationships that are on this faction but don't exist on the other faction.

Usually, the relation flags should be the same on both factions, and
matchrelations makes this easier. However, there may also be reasons to have
different relationship flags on each side.

See also: FEDIT RELATION, OLC FACTIONS
#d
"FEDIT MAXREPUTATION" "FEDIT MAX REPUTATION" "FEDIT MINREPUTATION" "FEDIT MIN REPUTATION"

Usage:  .maxreputation <reputation>
        .minreputation <reputation>

These settings determine the highest and lowest reputations a player can
possibly have with this faction. Players can never move outside this range,
no matter how much reputation they gain or lose. They will still gain/lose
rep with related factions when at these limits.

See also: OLC FACTIONS, OLC LEVELS, REPUTATIONS
#d
"FEDIT RELATION" "FEDIT RELATIONS" "FEDIT RELATIONSHIPS" "RELATIONSHIP FLAGS"

Usage:  .relation <name/vnum> flags [which flags]
        .relation <name/vnum> delete

Factions can have relationships with other factions. This affects how players
gain reputation with one faction, based on their reputation with another.

These flags determine the kind of relationship:
 SHARED-GAINS - Allies: If a player gains rep with that faction, they also gain
   this one, and vice versa.
 INVERSE-GAINS - Enemies: If a player gains rep with that faction, they lose
   rep with this one, and vice versa.
 MUTUALLY-EXCLUSIVE - If a player has a positive reputation with that faction,
   they cannot gain rep with this faction at all.
 UNLISTED - This relationship will not show to players on the faction info.

Note: If a reputation gain/loss is from killing a mob, it will only affect
  related factions with REP-FROM-KILLS flags, whether the original faction
  had this flag or not.

See also: FEDIT MATCH RELATIONS, OLC FACTIONS
#d
"FEDIT STARTINGREPUTATION" "FEDIT STARTING REPUTATION"

Usage:  .startingreputation <reputation>

This is the reputation level a player starts at when they first meet the
faction. Usually players start at neutral, but there are reasons to start
higher or lower. For example, perhaps you start out Despised by a faction
and must work your way up into their good graces. Or, start out Revered by
a faction but lose reputation over time.

See also: OLC FACTIONS, OLC LEVELS, REPUTATIONS
#d
"GEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

This set of flags applies to the global table itself.

Available flags:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - Will not be used live.
 ADVENTURE-ONLY - This global table will only apply to the adventure it's in.
 CUMULATIVE-PRC - Percent check will be cumulative.
 CHOOSE-LAST - The first choose-last global that passes the percent check will
    be saved for later, and only used if no other global succeeds. This can
    be used to create 100% "choose if nothing else passes" final cases.

See also: GEDIT PERCENT, OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MAXLEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This sets the upper limit of the level range for this global table.

For example, a 'Mob Interactions' global table will only be used if the mob
is scaled to this maxlevel or lower.

You can set the maximum to 0 for "no maximum".

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MINLEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This sets the lower limit of the level range for this global table.

For example, a 'Mob Interactions' global table will only be used if the mob
is scaled to this minlevel or higher.

You can set the minimum to 0 for "no minimum".

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MOBEXCLUDE"

Usage:  .mobexclude [add | remove] <flags>

A 'Mob Interactions' global table may have mob flags set to exclude. If so, the
global table is only used if a mob DOES NOT have all the flags in this set.
For example, you can use it to create a set that does not apply to HARD mobs.

These are the same set of flags from HELP MEDIT FLAGS.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT MOBFLAGS"

Usage:  .mobflags [add | remove] <flags>

A 'Mob Interactions' global table may have mob flags set. If so, the global
table is only used if a mob has ALL of the flags set here. For example, you
might set a global table to only apply to HARD mobs.

These are the same set of flags from HELP MEDIT FLAGS.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

This lets you set the 'name' property of a global table. Names are only shown
to the immortal staff, never to players. The name should indicate what this
table is for.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT PERCENT" CUMULATIVE-PRC

Usage:  .percent <amount>

This allows you to add a chance of choosing this global, between 0.01 and
100 (default is 100). When a global would be selected, its percent is checked.

You can make the percent check cumulative, in order to link several different
globals together. If multiple globals have the CUMULATIVE-PRC flag, only one
of them will be chosen (if any), based on a cumulative percentage.

More than one global may be selected if the CUMULATIVE-PRC flag is not set.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT REQUIRESABILITY" "GEDIT REQUIRES ABILITY"

Usage:  .requiresability <name | none>

This allows you to require the player to have a certain ability in order to
trigger this global (of any type). Setting it to 'none' removes this
requirement.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT SECTOREXCLUDE"

Usage:  .sectorexclude [add | remove] <flags>

A 'Mine Data' global table may have sector flags set to exclude. If so, the
global table is only used if a tile DOES NOT have all the flags in this set.
For example, you can use it to create a set that does not apply to ROUGH sects.

These are the same set of flags from HELP SECTEDIT FLAGS.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT SECTORFLAGS"

Usage:  .sectorflags [add | remove] <flags>

A 'Mine Data' global table may have sector flags set. If so, the global table
is only used if a tile has ALL of the flags set here. For example, you might
set a global table to only apply to ROUGH sectors.

These are the same set of flags from HELP SECTEDIT FLAGS.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GEDIT TYPE"

Usage:  .type <type>

This is the type of global table. Different types are used for different
things. Each type may have its own properties.

Types:
 Mob Interactions - Used for global SHEAR, LOOT, and PICKPOCKET tables.

See also: OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GLOBAL MINE DATA" "MINE DATA GLOBAL"

The 'Mine Data' global type is used for determining what type of mine a given
mountain (or any sector) tile will have. The basic elements required are:

1. A sector with the CAN-MINE flag (e.g. #8 Mountain).
2. A building with the MINE flag which can be built upon that sector (like 
   #5107 Mine).
3. At least one global with the 'Mine Data' type, with matching sector flags
   for your sector (e.g. #199).

If there is more than one matching Mine Data global, the percentages on those
globals will be used. Only the first match will be selected, as each map tile
can only have 1 global vnum. Once the tile has been prospected or a mine has
been built upon it, "stat room" will show "mine global vnum:" under extra data,
indicating which global was chosen.

When a player or Workforce NPC mines on that tile, it will run the interactions
ONLY from that one chosen Mine Data global, not from other matching globals.
This means that once a mine is established, it stays the same type of mine.
However, if the interaction list in that global has more than one possible
result, any of those results might appear from any successful swing of the
pick.

Notes on Mine Data globals:
- You should name the global something like "iron mine", as it is used to build
  certain strings, such as "This appears to be an iron mine."
- The sector flags and excludes match the base map terrain the mine was built
  upon, not the Building sector type of the mine itself. Setting ROUGH on the
  global's sector flags will match the ROUGH mountain.
- The capacity is a maximum. Mines normally have between 50% and 100% of this
  maximum, at random. Deep mines have 75% to 150% of this range.
- The level requirements, if you set any, will apply to the total level of the
  player who is prospecting or who builds the mine.

See also: BUILDING GUIDE, OLC GLOBALS
#d
"GLOBAL NEWBIE GEAR" "NEWBIE GEAR GLOBAL"

The 'Newbie Gear' Global allows the same gear list options as Archetypes,
but this is given to all newbie characters.

Notes on Newbie Gear globals:
- Only the percent field (and cumulative flag) really affect this type of
  global. The other usual global controls like exclude flags and level
  restrictions don't apply.
- Gear from archetypes is given first, so players only receive gear from
  globals in equipment slots not already filled. (This doesn't apply to
  inventory.)

See also: GEDIT GEAR
#d
"GLOBAL MOB INTERACTIONS" "MOB INTERACTIONS GLOBAL" "MOB INTERACTION GLOBAL"

The 'Mob Interactions' Global allows SHEAR, LOOT, and PICKPOCKET globals to
be applied to all mobs in a matching range. This can be used for loot tables
that are adventure-wide, or truly global.

Notes on Mob Interactions globals:
- Only SHEAR, LOOT, and PICKPOCKET mob interactions are supported.
- The min/max levels, if any, apply to the mobs (not the player attacking the
  mob). If the mob normally has a range of 150-250, and is scaled to 175, it
  will not trigger a global loot interaction that requires 200-250. But the
  same mob scaled to 225 would.

See also: BUILDING GUIDE, OLC GLOBALS
#d
IN-DEVELOPMENT "IN DEVELOPMENT" IN-DEV

The IN-DEVELOPMENT flag prevents an augment, craft, global, or other type from
being available to players. Generally immortals can still use them (although
they won't appear in craft lists).

You can quickly remove the IN-DEV flag using the .removeindev command. The OLC
auditors will warn about items that still have IN-DEV flags.

See also: OLC AUDIT, REMOVEINDEV
#d
"ITEM SCALING" "OBJ SCALING" "OBJECT SCALING" SCALABLE "SCALABLE FLAG" "SCALING ITEM"

Items can be set to scale to different levels. You can set various traits on
the item, and their relative strengths, but the actual strength levels are set
by the game engine.

To make a scalable item, set:
 - the SCALABLE flag
 - the minlevel property (optional)
 - the maxlevel property (optional)
 - the SUPERIOR, ENCHANTED, or JUNK flags (optional, each changes the scaling)
 - values and applies (see below)

When you set applies, instead of setting the level you want them at, set a
number that indicates relative power. For example, if you want all applies to
be the same, set them all to 1. If you have three applies and want one to be
stronger than the other two, set them 2, 1, 1. The game engine will choose
the final numbers for these.

You can also set applies to be negative, to give a penalty to that trait and
get bonus points for the item's positive traits. Negatives should be set based
on how negative you want them to be, NOT relative to the positive applies. The
final number for these will still be chosen by the game engine. -1 is a small
penalty, -3 is a larger one.

Some item types have values that are also set by the game engine. For these,
you should assign a positive number that's relative to the numbers you set
for applies (see above). For example, setting a weapon's damage to 1 gives it
the same weight as an apply of 1. If your item ONLY has one property to set
(e.g. drink container, which has no applies), you should just set its value to
1 because the actual number doesn't matter, so long as it's greater than 0.

Scaling based on item types:
 weapon - the "damage" value
 drink container - the "capacity" value
 coins - the "coinamount" value
 missile weapons - the "damage" value
 arrow - the "damage" value
 pack - the "capacity" value
 potion - the "potionscale" value

Applies and item values of 0 are ignored and do not get any points assigned.

#d
"MAP OLC" "OLC MAP" "WORLD OLC" "MAP EDITOR" MAPEDIT

Usage:  .map <command>

The .olc map editor is a tool for modifying and customizing individual parts
of the map. Unlike the other editors, it doesn't use contextual menus. The
map editor commands make instant changes to the map where you're standing.

You can get help on any of the mapeditor commands with &yHELP MAPEDIT <COMMAND>&0.
The following commands are available:
 complete - Finishes the building you're standing in.
 decay - Performs 1 year of decay (building, trench, mine data) on the tile.
 decustomize - Removes custom icon, name, and description.
 deleteexit - Removes an exit (careful about cutting off building interiors).
 deleteroom - Deletes the room you're standing in (interior rooms only).
 description - Customize the description on an interior room.
 exit - Add a new exit between two interior rooms (similar to interlink).
 icon - Customize the map icon.
 maintain - Repairs and maintains a building.
 name - Customize the room title.
 naturalize - Returns this tile to its 'natural terrain'.
 passwalls - Able to move on the map unblocked by walls, interiors, etc.
 populate - Forces a building/room to populate an npc, if possible.
 remember - Stores the current terrain as the 'natural terrain'.
 roomtype - Change the type of an interior room.
 ruin - Turn a building to ruins.
 terrain - Change the tile you're standing on.
 unclaimable - Make a tile or square of tiles unclaimable (or not).

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

#d
"MAPEDIT BUILD"

Usage:  .map build <building vnum> [direction]

This command creates a building instantly, without needing a craft recipe. It
can be built on virtually any map tile, so be careful when using this. Its main
purpose is to add special buildings to the map without needing a build recipe.

Example:
 > .map build 5118
 > .map build 5120 north

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT COMPLETE"

Usage:  .map complete

This command finishes an unfinished building or room, if you're standing in
one. This is the easiest way for an immortal to build a building.

Example:
 > .map terrain plains
 > build largehouse north
 > .map complete

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DECUSTOMIZE"

Usage:  .map decustomize

This command removes any custom name, icon, and description from a map tile
or room.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DELETEEXIT" "MAPEDIT DELETE EXIT"

Usage:  .map deleteexit <direction>

This command removes an exit in one direction. It does not remove the other
side's corresponding exit back, and it does not delete the room that was
linked to that exit.

You should be careful not to leave orphaned rooms or areas that players cannot
get back out of.

See also: MAPEDIT DELETE ROOM, MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DELETEROOM" "MAPEDIT DELETE ROOM"

Usage:  .map deleteroom ok

This commmand deletes the room you are standing in. It only works on interior
(designated) rooms, and cannot be used out on the map. It will automatically
delete any exits that link to the room you're in.

Be careful about deleting rooms in the middle of buildings, as you may orphan
part of the building and make it unreachable.

See also: MAPEDIT DELETE EXIT, MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT DESCRIPTION" "CUSTOM DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .map description set
        .map description none

This command allows you to set or remove a custom description on the room you
are standing in. This generally only applies to interior (designated) rooms,
but it can also be used to create custom roadsigns on roads (which show their
custom description as a sign).

See also: MAP OLC, ROADSIGN
#d
"MAPEDIT EXIT"

Usage:  .map exit <direction> <vnum>
        .map exit <direction> <new>

This command allows you to add new exits or rooms to an existing map building.
Unlike designate, adding new rooms this way is not limited by the size of the
building.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT ICON"

Usage:  .map icon <icon>
        .map icon none

This command allows you to add or remove a custom icon for a map tile. Like
all icons, it must be 4 characters wide (not counting color codes). Custom
icons must always start with a color code (usually &&0).

Remember that the map may be rotated for some players (especially new or drunk
players), so using multiple icons to give the appearance of a larger structure
on the map may not look correctly for all players.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .map name <name>
        .map name none

This command allows you to set or remove a custom room title on the map or in
designated rooms.

Important notes:
- Room titles are colored by the banner of the empire that owns them, so you
  should avoid color codes in them.
- Room titles are shown in some lists (e.g. the territory command), so they
  should usually be short.
- Custom room titles can help players distinguish between things like different
  starting locations, if you name them well.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT NATURALIZE"

Usage:  .map naturalize [island | world]

This command will restore the sector for the map tile you're in, the whole
island you're on, or the entire world. The tiles return to the state they
were in when the map was first generated.

When used on an island/world, claimed tiles are ignored. So are tiles that are
unclaimable or which have adventures.

You can change a tile/island's natural state with: .map remember [island]

See also: MAP OLC, MAPEDIT REMEMBER
#d
"MAPEDIT PASSWALLS"

Usage:  .map passwalls

This toggle allows an immortal to roam freely on the map without being blocked
by terrain or buildings. When passwalls is active, the immortal cannot enter
the interior (designated) rooms of a building; they will instead move to the
next map tile in the direction that they were walking.

See also: MAP OLC
#d
"MAPEDIT REMEMBER"

Usage:  .map remember [island]

This command will store the current sector of the map tile you're in (or the
entire island you're on) as the "natural" sector. This can be used to change
how a newbie island will be restored at the end of the year, for example.

Building and adventure tiles are ignored during this command.

The opposite command is .map naturalize, which restores a room/island/world
to its original state.

See also: MAP OLC, MAPEDIT NATURALIZE
#d
"MAPEDIT ROOMTYPE" "MAPEDIT ROOM TYPE"

Usage:  .map roomtype <name>

This command allows you to change the type of a designated interior room, to
any available room type. Rooms are created with the building editor, and any
building with the ROOM flag can be set this way.

See also: MAP OLC, OLC BUILDINGS
#d
"MAPEDIT RUINS"

Usage:  .map ruin

This command will reduce a map building to ruins.
#d
"MAPEDIT TERRAIN"

Usage:  .map terrain <type>

This command allows you to change the sector type (terrain) of a map tile.
It can be used to clear space for building an immortal's home, or to remove
a building on the map.

Example:
 > .map terrain Tower of Souls

See also: MAP OLC, MAPEDIT UNCLAIMABLE
#d
"MAPEDIT UNCLAIMABLE"

Usage:  .map unclaimable [size]

This command allows you to toggle the unclaimable status of the map tile you
are in, or of a larger area around it. The whole area is toggled on if the
room you're standing in is toggled on, and vice versa.

By tradition, EmpireMUD sets the area around starting locations as unclaimable
so that nobody can build guard towers that threaten players on the start spot.

Example:
 > .map terrain Tower of Souls
 > .map unclaimable 3

See also: MAP OLC, MAPEDIT TERRAIN
#d
"MEDIT AFFECTS"

Usage:  .affects [add | remove] <flags>

This command adds, removes, or toggles a set of affect flags. These flags are
always active on the mob, as if a spell had been cast on them.

See also: AFFECT FLAGS, OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT ALLEGIANCE"

Usage:  .allegiance <none | vnum | name>

This sets a mob to be a member of a faction. For some factions, this will cause
reputation gain if a player kills the mob.

See also: FACTION, OLC FACTIONS, OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT ATTACK" "ATTACK TYPES"

Usage:  .attack <type>

This command sets the base attack type of the mobile. It will deal damage as
if it was using a weapon of that type.

For humans with no weapon, use #16 hit.

The following attack types are available:
 1. RESERVED - do not use
 2. slash - sword
 3. slice - axe

#d
"MEDIT CUSTOM"

Usage:  .custom add <type> <message>
        .custom change <number> <type | message> <value>
        .custom remove <number | all>

You can set custom messages on mobs, which are shown at different times
depending upon the type of message.

Some messages may use the tokens $n/$e/$s/$m for name/he/his/him for the mob.

If you set more than one message of the same type, one will be chosen at
random each time.

Message types:
 &cecho&0 - The message is shown to the room periodically (may use $ tokens).
 &csay&0 - The message is said aloud by the mob periodically.

Note: The 'echo' and 'say' types share the same random interval, and the mob
will only do one or the other each time.

See also: OLC MOBILES, DOLLAR SIGN CODES
#d
"MEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags <type>

This command toggles mob flags. These flags affect the default behavior. Note
that you cannot remove flag #4 ISNPC -- this indicates the mob is an NPC.

Never set a flag marked with an * (asterisk).

Available mob flags:
 BRING-A-FRIEND - Assists any non-charmed mob in combat.
 SENTINEL - Stays in one room and never wanders.
 AGGR - Aggressive; will attack players.

#d
"MEDIT INTERACTION" "BEDIT INTERACTION" "OEDIT INTERACTION" "REDIT INTERACTION" "SECTEDIT INTERACTION" "CROPEDIT INTERACTION" "GEDIT INTERACTION" INTERACTIONS

Usage:  .interaction add <type> <quantity> <vnum> <percent> [exclusion code]
        .interaction change <number> <field> <value>
        .interaction copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .interaction remove <number | all>
        .interaction move <number> <up | down>

This command adds or removes an interaction. These are objects or mobs that are
generated by certain commands. Some are only used on mobs, while others are
only used on rooms. You can copy interactions from other mobs, buildings,
rooms, sectors, and crops -- this may save you time if many are the same.

Mob interaction types:
 BUTCHER - Items received when the Butcher ability is used.
 SKIN - Items received via the skin command.
 SHEAR - Items received when the shear command is used in a stable.
 BARDE - Mob loaded when the Barde ability is used in a stable.
 LOOT - Items dropped into the corpse when the mob is killed.
 PICKPOCKET - Items gained from the pickpocket skill.
 
Object interaction types:
 LIGHT - Item something is converted into when lit on fire.
 COMBINE** - Combine multiple copies of an obj into another obj (quantity is the
    number required, rather than number you get).
 SEPARATE** - Split this item into multiple other items.
 ** Both COMBINE and SEPARATE should be set exclusive, as they will extract
    the original item.
 SCRAPE - Items you get when scraping this item (tree -> log).
 SAW - Items you get when sawing this item (tree -> lumber).
 TAN - Items you get when tanning this item (skin -> leather).
 CHIP - What you get for chipping at the item.

Room interaction types:
 DIG - Items received when using the dig action.
 FORAGE - Items received when using the Forage ability.
 FIND-HERB - Items found when picking, if the user has Find Herbs.
 HARVEST - Items received when harvesting a crop, OR when picking in an ORCHARD crop.
 GATHER - Items received from the gather action.
 ENCOUNTER - Hostile mob loaded when a random encounter triggers.
 CHOP - Things that can be found when chopping here.
 FISH - Things that can be found by fishing here.
 PAN - Things that can be found by panning here.
 QUARRY - Things you can find by quarrying here.

The percent may be anywhere from 0.01 to 100.00 and if the quantity is greater
than 1, the percent is only checked once for the entire quantity. If you want
each copy of an item to have its own percent roll, list them separately as
quantity 1.

The exclusion code (optional) may be any letter, which changes how random
interactions are chosen. All items with the same exclusion code have a cumu-
lative roll (meaning if the percents add up to 100, one of them is guaranteed)
but only one item from the same exclusion set will ever pass. The rest will
fail. If you don't set an exclusion code, the interaction is not exclusive and
always gets its own percent roll.

You can use '.interact move' to rearrange entries. Interactions are always
processed from top to bottom.

Example of a rare result from barding (order matters here):
 1. BARDE: 1x an epic warhorse .50% (e)
 2. BARDE: 1x a warhorse 100% (e)

Example of possible multiple results from shear:
 1. SHEAR: 1x some wool 100.00%
 2. SHEAR: 1x some wool 50.00%
 3. SHEAR: 1x some wool 5.00%

#d
"MEDIT KEYWORDS"

Usage:  .keywords <keywords>

This command updates the keywords on a mob. The keywords are a list of single
words that can be used to target the mob. It should include any words from the
mob's short or long description that identify the mob.

Usually the most significant keyword should be first.

Example:
 name: a fiery dragon
 long description: A huge red dragon is flying overhead!
 keywords: dragon fiery huge red

See also: MEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION, MEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION
#d
"MEDIT MAXLEVEL" "MEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This command determines the maximum level a mobile will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. If you're unsure how to scale the mob, check the levels on some players.

If you set the maxlevel to 0, there will be no maximum and the mob can scale
to any level over the minimum.

See also: MEDIT MINLEVEL, OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT MINLEVEL" "MEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This command determines the minimum level a mobile will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. If you're unsure how to scale the mob, check the levels on some players.

If you set the minlevel to 0, there will be no lower limit and mobs can scale
to any level under the maximum.

See also: MEDIT MAXLEVEL, OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT MOVETYPE" "MEDIT MOVE TYPE"

Usage:  .movetype <type>

The move type determines what message is sent when the mob moves. Sometimes
other types are substituted, for example a flying mob always says "flies" even
if its move type is different.

See also: OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT NAMESET" "MEDIT NAME SET"

Usage:  .nameset <set>

Name sets are used for mobs that have #n in their strings. This feature allows
a mob to appear to be unique by giving each copy of the mob a random name from
the set. The various name sets contain different themed names.

See also: OLC MOBILES, #n
#d
"MEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION" "MEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .longdescription <string>

The long description is the text you see when the mobile is in the room. Its
name should appear somewhere near the beginning, and the rest should be a
complete sentence indicating that the mobile is present.

Examples:
There is a cow munching on some grass.
A fiery dragon circles overhead.
You're standing at the foot of a huge giant!

See also: OLC MOBILES
#d
"ADVEDIT SCRIPTS" "BEDIT SCRIPTS" "MEDIT SCRIPTS" "OEDIT SCRIPTS" "QEDIT SCRIPTS" "REDIT SCRIPTS" "VEDIT SCRIPTS"

Usage:  .script add [position] <trigger vnum>
        .script copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .script remove <number | all>

You can attach triggers to mob, objects, and room templates using this option.
Triggers run in the order they appear in the OLC list, so you can optionally
choose which position to insert them at, if there are multiple scripts. If you
don't give a position, it will put it at the end.

When you save your olc editor, all live copies of the thing you were editing
should get the updated script list right away.

Note: Adventure scripts will only work if they are the Adventure Cleanup type.

"MEDIT SEX"

Usage:  .medit sex <male | female | neutral>

This command sets the sex of the NPC. This matters mostly in action messages,
where it determines the pronouns. Animals are almost always set to neutral,
while humans should always be set to male or female. Use your best judgment.

See also: OLC MOBILES
#d
"MEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION" "MEDIT SHORT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .shortdescription <string>

The 'short description' is the trait that's shown in lists, in action messages,
and almost everywhere else except when a player types 'look' in the room (where
the long description is shown instead). This should be short, should generally
begin with a/an/the unless it's a proper noun, and should not be capitalized
(again unless it's a proper noun).

Examples:
 the dragon
 a mongoose
 Charles the Great

#d
MINIPET MINI-PET "MINI PET" "PET WHISTLE"

Mini-pets are a common cosmetic reward from adventure zones. They are summoned
from a reusable item, and the player may get that item from a loot drop or a
shop.

To create a pet whistle (or other summoner item), attach script 9900 (Mini-pet
Use) to an object and set its <value0> to the mini-pet mob's vnum.

Mini-pet mobs should have the following traits:
 - Flags: SENTINEL SPAWNED !LOOT (and ISNPC)
 - Affects: !ATTACK
 - Scripts: 9901 (Dismissable), 9902 (Lonely Despawn)
 - Adorable custom messages (optional)
#d
MORPHEDIT "OLC MORPHS" "MORPH EDITOR"

Usage:  .morph <command>
        .command

The .olc morph editor allows you to configure the data for morphs, which are
used by players (and NPCs) to change shape.

All commands in the editor arg highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these commands by typing &yHELP MORPHEDIT <COMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
> .morph edit 123
> .shortdesc a shapeshifting demon
> .save

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

#d
"MORPHEDIT AFFECTS"

Usage:  .affects [add | remove] <flags>

This command adds, removes, or toggles a set of affect flags. These flags are
given to players while they are in this form.

See also: AFFECT FLAGS, OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT APPLY" "MORPHEDIT APPLIES"

Usage:  .apply add <value> <apply>
        .apply change <number> <value | apply> <new value>
        .apply remove <number | all>

Applies are bonuses (or penalties) that a morph grants to the player who is
using it.

See also: APPLIES, OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT ATTACK"

Usage:  .attack <type>

This command sets the base attack type of the morph, when unarmed.

See also: ATTACK TYPES, OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT COST" "MORPHEDIT COSTTYPE" "MORPHEDIT COST TYPE"

Usage:  .cost <amount>
        .costtype <health | move | mana | blood>

This allows you to set the cost to use a morph. If a cost is set, the player
must spend that much of the given type in order to start morphing.

If the cost is 0, the cost type doesn't matter. Players can't go below 1 health
or blood, so they must have cost+1 in order to morph. If the cost type is
blood, Heartstop can prevent the player from morphing.

See also: OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT FLAGS" "MORPH FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following morph flags are available:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - Not live yet (can't be used by players).
 SCRIPT-ONLY - Players can't choose this morph, but scripts can.
 ANIMAL - Morph counts as an animal and is disguised from other players.
 VAMPIRE-ONLY - This is a vampire morph and will check sunlight.
 TEMPERATE-AFFINITY - Can only be used on temperate terrain.
 ARID-AFFINITY - Can only be used on arid terrain (desert).
 TROPICAL-AFFINITY - Can only be used on tropical terrain (jungle).
 CHECK-SOLO - Can't be used if in the Solo role and not solo.
 !SLEEP - Cannot sleep in this form.
 GENDER-NEUTRAL - Shows as "it" instead of he/she/him/her.
 CONSUME-OBJ - Will use up the requiresobj to morph.
 !FASTMORPH - This morph won't work with 'fastmorph'.

#d
"MORPHEDIT KEYWORDS"

Usage:  .keywords <keywords>

This command updates the keywords on a morph. The keywords are a list of single
words that can be used to target a person in this morph. It should include any
words from the morph's short or long description that identify the person.

Usually the most significant keyword should be first.

Example:
 name: a fiery dragon
 long description: A huge red dragon is flying overhead!
 keywords: dragon fiery huge red

See also: MORPHEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION, MORPHEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION, OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION" "MORPHEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .longdescription <string>

The long description is the text you see when the morphed character is in the
room. Its name should appear somewhere near the beginning, and the rest should
be a complete sentence indicating that the person is present.

Examples:
There is a cow munching on some grass.
A fiery dragon circles overhead.
You're standing at the foot of a huge giant!

See also: OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT MAXLEVEL" "MORPHEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This command determines the maximum level a morph will scale to. Morphs scale
in power to the level of the player/npc who is morphing, up to this maximum.

If you set the maxlevel to 0, there will be no maximum and the morph can scale
to any level.

See also: OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT MOVETYPE" "MORPHEDIT MOVE TYPE"

Usage:  .movetype <type>

The move type determines what message is sent when the morphed person moves.
Sometimes other types are substituted, for example a flying person always says
"flies" even if its move type is different.

See also: OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT REQUIRESABILITY" "MORPHEDIT REQUIRES ABILITY"

Usage:  .requiresability <name | none>

This allows you to require the player to have a certain ability in order to
use this morph. Setting it to 'none' removes this requirement.

See also: OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT REQUIRESOBJECT" "MORPHEDIT REQUIRES OBJECT"

Usage:  .requiresobject <vnum>

Some morphs may require a specific object. If the user doesn't have the object,
the morph won't show up in the list at all. This essentially associates the
morph to the object.

The required object isn't consumed when the person morphs, unless the CONSUME-
OBJ flag is set. You should never use a scalable item if it will be consumed.

See also: OLC MORPHS
#d
"MORPHEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION" "MORPHEDIT SHORT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .shortdescription <string>

The 'short description' is the trait that's shown in lists, in action messages,
and almost everywhere else except when a player types 'look' in the room (where
the long description is shown instead). This should be short, should generally
begin with a/an/the unless it's a proper noun, and should not be capitalized
(again unless it's a proper noun).

The short description is also shown in the available morphs list (with any
leading a/an/the removed).

Examples:
 the dragon
 a mongoose

See also: MORPHEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION, OLC MORPHS
#d
"MOUNT WHISTLE" WHISTLE "MOUNT REWARD"

Mount whistles (or other similar items) are used to reward players with mounts
using the loot drop table of an NPC. Players seem to prefer receiving their
new mount as an item, because it's easier to get it out of the adventure if
they can't mount it right away.

If you load a mount directly into the room in an adventure, players will often
kill it without realizing what it is. Another problem is that if the player
leads a mount out of the adventure, the mount may despawn when the adventure
despawns.

To create a mount whistle, attach script 10263 (Mount whistle use) to an
object, and set the object's <value0> field to the vnum of the mount.
#d
"OEDIT AFFECTS"

Usage:  .affects [add | remove] <flags>

This command adds, removes, or toggles a set of affect flags. These flags
are set on the character who equips this object, as if they had a spell cast
on them.

See also: AFFECT FLAGS, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT APPLY" "OEDIT APPLIES" APPLIES

Usage:  .apply add <value> <apply> [type]
        .apply change <number> <value | apply | type> <new value>
        .apply remove <number | all>

Applies are bonuses (or penalties) that an item gives to the player who is
using it. The following applies are available.

Apply types (optional) let you specify which applies come from enchantments or
other sources (the default is "natural"). The superior and *-drop apply types
will only appear on the item if it has matching flags.

Most applies are self-explanatory:
 STRENGTH - characters can't use an item that would reduce them below 1
 DEXTERITY - chance to hit/dodge
 HEALTH-REGEN - rate of health regen (per 5 second tick)
 CHARISMA - characters can't use an item that would reduce them below 1
 GREATNESS - empire meta-trait (unscaled)
 MOVE-REGEN - rate of move regen (per 5 second tick)
 MANA-REGEN - rate of mana regen (per 5 second tick)
 INTELLIGENCE - characters can't use an item that would reduce them below 1
 WITS - combat speed and damage
 AGE - this actually raises/lowers the player's age, which has no effect
 MAX-MOVE - move pool
 RESIST-PHYSICAL - physical damage reduction
 BLOCK - block only matters if the player has a shield
 * - not used
 MAX-HEALTH - health pool
 MAX-MANA - mana pool
 TO-HIT - chance to hit (%)
 DODGE - chance to dodge (%)
 INVENTORY - this adds to inventory capacity
 MAX-BLOOD - blood pool size
 BONUS-PHYSICAL - added to strength-based damage and weapon dps
 BONUS-MAGICAL - added to magical damage and weapon dps
 BONUS-HEALING - added to damage healed (by abilities this player uses)
 RESIST-MAGICAL - magical damage reduction
 CRAFTING - bonus to craft level (unscaled)
 BLOOD-UPKEEP - adds to how much blood vampires must spend per hour (unscaled)

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT ARMORTYPE" "OEDIT ARMOR TYPE"

Usage:  .armortype <type>

Armor items may have several different types set. This determines which ability
is required to wear the item. If an item does not need to be skill-restricted,
use the WORN item type instead of ARMOR.

mage - Should provide caster or healer traits and no real protection.
light - Should provide melee DPS traits.
medium - Should provide both DPS and tank traits, such as to-hit and dodge.
heavy - Should include a -WITS or -STRENGTH penalty, and should include only
   tank traits.

See also: OLC OBJECTS, APPLIES
#d
"OEDIT ARROWTYPE" "OEDIT ARROW TYPE"

Usage:  .arrowtype <letter>

Arrow type is a property you set on missile weapons (e.g. bows) and arrow
objects, to match the two up together. An arrow object any kind (whether it's
actually an arrow, or a bolt, or whatever) can only be used on a bow with the
same arrow type.

Arrow types are single letters, like 'A', 'B', and so on. You can find a list
of existing items and their arrowtypes by typing "show arrowtypes".

Common arrow types:
 A - arrows

#d
"OEDIT AUTOMINT" "OEDIT AUTO MINT"

Usage:  .automint <on|off>

This allows a wealth item to be automatically minted into coins by Workforce.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT TEXT" "OEDIT BOOK"

Usage:  .text <book vnum>

You can create book objects to place in your adventure zones. Like ordinary
books, their name will be overridden by the name set in the book editor. You
can see the book id of any book you've written by typing "bookedit list" (it's
the number in the [brackets]), or via "vnum book".

(This field was formerly called ".book" but was changed because it conflicts
with the book editor.)

See also: BOOKEDIT, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CAPACITY"

Usage:  .capacity <number>

Some items have a capacity trait, which determines how many items (or drinks)
they can hold. In the case of drink containers, the capacity is measured in
hours of thirst-quenching. In all other cases, this capacity is number of
items (LARGE items count double).

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT CONTENTS, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CHARGES"

Usage:  .charges <number>

Some items have a 'charges' trait which determines how many times they can
be used. You need to provide at least 1 charge for the item to be useful.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT COINAMOUNT" "OEDIT COIN AMOUNT"

Usage:  .coinamount <number>

This sets how many coins are in a COINS-type object. You can't set what empire
the coins belong to; they will always be "other".

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT TYPE, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT COMPONENT" "OEDIT COMP" "COMPONENT TYPES"

Usage:  .component <type>

This sets the object to be a generic component. These are things used in
craft recipes (and other resource lists) that can accept any item of a
generic type. An item should only be a component if it could be used as a
generic part of a crafting recipe.

Once you choose a component type, you can also set the .compflags property
to add modifiers to your component type.

Available components (common flags listed in parentheses):
 &cadhesive&0 - not currently used
 &cbone&0 - not currently used
 &cblock&0 - building materials like bricks or blocks
 &cclay&0 - moldable clay
 &cdye&0 - any kind of dye
 &cfeathers&0 - not currently used
 &cfibers&0 - cotton, straw, etc.
 &cflour&0 - ground up grains
 &cfruit&0 - for cooking

#d
"OEDIT COMPFLAGS" "OEDIT COMPONENT FLAGS" "COMPONENT FLAGS"

Usage:  .compflags [add | remove] <flags>

Component flags are modifiers to the generic component type. When a recipe
requires a component with certain flags, the object must have all those flags.
These flags are interpreted loosely -- it's only important that they match.

&rDon't over-assign flags.&0 Only use these flags if there is a real distinction
or reason to use them. Most of these flags come in pairs (magic/mundane) and
you only need to assign the mundane flag if some versions of the resource are
magical and a recipe could require the non-magical version.

Available flags:
 &canimal&0 - From an animal (like animal fibers)
 &cbunch&0 - A group of things
 &cdesert&0 - Comes from the desert (especially foods)
 &cfine&0 - High-quality
 &chard&0 - As opposed to soft
 &clarge&0 - For example, large leather vs small leather
 &cmagic&0 - Has magical properties
 &cmundane&0 - Is very non-magical
 &cplant&0 - From a plant (like plant fibers)
 &cpoor&0 - Low-quality
 &crare&0 - Hard to find or premium
 &craw&0 - Natural, unrefined, or uncooked
 &crefined&0 - As opposed to raw
 &csingle&0 - An individual thing (not a group)
 &csmall&0 - As in small leather
 &csoft&0 - For things that can be soft or hard
 &ctemperate&0 - Comes from temperate areas (especially foods)
 &ctropical&0 - Comes from tropical areas (especially foods)
 &ccommon&0 - Opposite of rare
 &caquatic&0 - Comes from the water
 &cbasic&0 - A tier 1, minimum-level resource.

#d
"OEDIT CONTAINERFLAGS" "OEDIT CONTAINER FLAGS"

Usage:  .containerflags [add | remove] <flags>

This command adds or removes container flags.

Available flags are:
 CLOSEABLE - the container may be closed and opened
 CLOSED - the container is closed when it loads

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CONTENTS"

Usage:  .contents <amount>

Some items with a capacity, such as drink containers, also have a 'contents'
property. This is how full they are when they are loaded or dropped into the
world. If you want an item to start out empty, set its contents to 0. If you
want it to start out full, set it to the same amount as the capacity.

See also: OEDIT CAPACITY, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT CORPSEOF" "OEDIT CORPSE OF"

Usage:  .corpseof <mob vnum>

This allows you to set whose corpse an item is. You can leave real corpses in
your adventure zone, by creating corpse items and setting this value to one
of your mobs.

All corpse items must be the corpse of something (for skin/butcher data).

See also: VNUM
#d
"OEDIT CUSTOM" "CUSTOM MESSAGES"

Usage:  .custom add <type> <message>
        .custom change <number> <type | message> <value>
        .custom remove <number | all>

You can set custom messages on objects for various actions. These messages
may use the tokens $n/$e/$s/$m for name/he/his/him for the player using the
item, $p for the name of the item, $a for a/an for the item.

If you set more than one message of the same type, one will be chosen at
random each time.

Message types:
 &cbuild-to-char&0 - Shown to the character when the item is built into a building.
 &cbuild-to-room&0 - Shown to the room when the item is built into a building.
 &cinstrument-to-char&0 - Shown every few seconds to the person playing the instrument.
 &cinstrument-to-room&0 - Shown every few seconds to the room when someone is playing an instrument.
 &ceat-to-char&0 - Shown to the person when they eat the item.
 &ceat-to-room&0 - Shown to the room when a person eats an item.
 &ccraft-to-char&0 - Shown to the actor when building a vehicle ($V for vehicle).
 &ccraft-to-room&0 - Shown to the room when building a vehicle ($V for vehicle).
 &cwear-to-char&0 - Shown to the person when they wear an item ($p for item).

See also: OLC OBJECTS, DOLLAR SIGN CODES
#d
"OEDIT DAMAGE"

Usage:  .damage <amount>

This lets you set the damage on various types of weapons. Usually this amount
of damage is added to another number, like bow damage + arrow damage, or
strength + weapon damage.

When you set the damage, it will also give you the weapon's current DPS. This
is the amount of damage it deals per second, given its current attack type
or slow/fast flags.

Weapons that are slow but strong deal the same DPS as weapons that are fast
but weak. Some strategies prefer one way or the other. For most purposes, two
weapons are considered equal if their DPS (not their raw damage) is equal.

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

See also: ITEM SCALING, OEDIT MISSILESPEED, OEDIT WEAPONTYPE, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT EXTRA" "OEDIT EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS" "BEDIT EXTRA" "BEDIT EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS" "REDIT EXTRA" "REDIT EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS"

Usage:  .extra add <keywords>
        .extra change <number> <description | keywords> [value]
        .extra remove <number | all>

This command lets you add or edit extra descriptions. These are additional
descriptions that the player may 'look' at. 

For objects, the object's main description is set on the 'lookdescription'
command.

The keywords are a list of different words the player may look at, and the
associated description is shown when they do. When you add a new extra, it
immediately takes you into the string editor to write the description for the
keywords you chose.

Example in-game of a locket with extra description keyword "photo":
 > look locket
   The locket is worn but has a photo inside.
 > look photo
   It's a photo of a young girl.

 SCALABLE - item can be scaled (see HELP ITEM SCALING)
 TWO-HANDED - weapon requires both hand slots
 BOE - item binds to a player when it is equipped (or used)
 BOP - item binds to a player when it is picked up

#d
"OEDIT FULLNESS"

Usage:  .fullness <hours>

This determines how long a food item can make you full for when eaten, in game
hours (75 second intervals). The 'eat' command only eats part of food if the
player isn't hungry enough to eat the whole thing, which displays as "You eat
some of <item name>."

Examples of good fullness numbers:
 snack foods (apple) - 6 hours
 baskets of food (apples) - 24 hours
 prepared food (bread) - 48 hours

Foods should also have a decay timer set. Traditionally, more-prepared foods
take longer to decay, rather than basic it strictly on realism.

See also: OEDIT DECAY, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT FULLSEARCH"

Usage:  .o fullsearch -<field> <argument> <...>

This command allows you to search for objects matching certain criteria. You
can specify multiple fields if you want. Any arguments that don't start with a
dash (-) are matched to the object's keywords and short/long/look descriptions.

Fields:
  &c-affects&0 - see HELP AFFECT FLAGS
  &c-apply&0 - see HELP OEDIT APPLY
  &c-cflagged&0, &cnotcflagged&0 - see HELP COMPONENT FLAGS
  &c-component&0 - see HELP OEDIT COMPONENT
  &c-custom&0 - has a specific type, see HELP OEDIT CUSTOM
  &c-flagged&0, &cnotflagged&0 - see HELP OEDIT FLAGS
  &c-interaction&0 - has a specific type, see HELP OEDIT INTERACTION
  &c-level&0 - matches anything where this level is within the range
     (note: will not account for objects whose levels are inherited from mobs
     or adventures, see ADVEDIT CASCADE for help)
  &c-material&0 - see OEDIT MATERIAL
  &c-type&0 - see HELP OEDIT TYPE
  &c-wear&0 - see HELP OEDIT WEAR

Examples:
 > .o fullsearch -type WEAPON -wear HOLD
 > .o fullsearch -flagged LARGE -flagged TOOL-SHOVEL
 > .o fullsearch -level 50 sword

To search other fields, you can generally use the normal "search" option for
other OLC types. For example, to find all objects with the "Mini-pet Use"
trigger, use ".t search 9900".
#d
"OEDIT KEYWORDS"

Usage:  .keywords <list>

Keywords are the terms you can use to interact with an item. This is a list
of all available one-word terms. Any identifying word in an object's name
or long description should go in the keywords.

Usually the most significant or unique word goes first in the keyword list.
Some commands use the first keyword to auto-repeat, so if the keywords would
be ambiguous like "ore iron", you can add "ironore" as the first keyword to
help the game identify the correct object for repeating commands like smelt.

Examples:
 name: a wailing phaester
 long description: A huge, wailing phaister is lying here.
 keywords: phaester wailing huge

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT LIQUID"

Usage:  .liquid <type>

Drink containers hold a certain type of liquid. This only matters if the
'contents' property is greater than 0, as an empty drink container holds no
liquid at all. If a drink container is emptied, it can be refilled with any
type of liquid.

The name of the liquid is automatically appended to the name of the item, so
when "a flask" is full of ale, it becomes "a flask of ale". Keep this in mind
when naming your drink containers.

Available liquids are:
  water
  lager
  wheat beer
  ale
  cider
  milk
  blood
  honey
  bean soup
  coffee
  green tea
  red wine
  white wine
  grog
  mead
  stout

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION" "OEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION" "LONG DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .longdescription <text>

The long description is shown when the item is on the ground and the player
types 'look'. This is always a full sentence that describes the object as
present in the room. The name of the object should always be near the beginning
of the long description.

Examples:
 A sword is lying in the dirt.
 There is a sign stamped into the ground.
 A strange, humming orb is floating here.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT LOOKDESCRIPTION" "OEDIT LOOK DESCRIPTION" "LOOK DESCRIPTION" "ACTION DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .lookdescription

The look description (also called action description) is shown when a player
looks at or examines an object. For simple, common objects, this should tell
the player how to use the object. For decorative or impressive objects, it
should be a description of the object's majesty.

The look description is set in the string editor. If it is less than 80
characters long, it will fit on one line and should not be indented. If it
goes any longer than that, you should use /fi to format it with indent inside
the string editor.

See also: OLC OBJECTS, STRING EDITOR
#d
"OEDIT MATERIAL"

Usage:  .material <type>

Items are made out of various materials. This is used to determine if they can
float in water, what message is shown when they decay, and is also used by the
sacrifice and create commands to determine which resources the god gets or
spends.

Choose the material that best fits your object. If there isn't one that fits
at all, contact the programmer to discuss adding a new one. But remember, the
material doesn't need to be exact. It just needs to be close enough.

Available mat
  WOOD     ROCK      IRON
  SILVER   GOLD      FLINT
  CLAY     FLESH     GLASS
  WAX      MAGIC     CLOTH
  GEM      COPPER    BONE
  HAIR

"OEDIT MAXLEVEL" "OEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This command determines the maximum level a object will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. There is a full guide to item scaling at HELP ITEM SCALING.

If you set the maxlevel to 0, there will be no maximum and the obj can scale
to any level over the minimum.

#d
"OEDIT MINLEVEL" "OEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This command determines the minimum level a object will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear. There is a full guide to item scaling at HELP ITEM SCALING.

If you set the minlevel to 0, there will be no lower limit and objs can scale
to any level under the maximum.

#d
"OEDIT MISSILESPEED" "OEDIT MISSILE SPEED"

Usage:  .missilespeed <number>

This trait determines how fast a missile weapon (e.g. a bow) attacks in combat.
You cannot choose your own speed; you must pick from a list. You should always
specify the number in the list as your argument to this command.

The 'speed' trait is the number of seconds between attacks in combat, so a
lower number means a faster weapon. In that way, the name is backwards.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT REQUIRESQUEST" "OEDIT REQUIRES QUEST" "OEDIT REQUIRE QUEST" "OEDIT QUEST"

Usage:  .requiresquest <vnum | none>

Items can be set to require the player to be on a quest. The player cannot get
an object for a quest they're not on, and can't lose an object for a quest they
are on.

Requires objects will be lost when the quest ends.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT STORAGE"

Usage:  .storage add <building vnum> [flags]
        .storage change <number> <building | flags> <value>
        .storage remove <number | all>

This command lets you set where an object may be stored. An object type may
have any number of storage locations.

Available flags:
 WITHDRAW - This item requires the "withdraw" empire privilege.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT PLANTS"

Usage:  .plants <crop vnum>

Any object with the PLANTABLE flag needs its crop set. This actually uses
item value 2, so many object types will have conflicting values. You should
never set a weapon as plantable, for example.

PLANTABLE works best on OTHER and FOOD items. You shouldn't use any other type
unless you have a very good reason (and that type doesn't use value 2 for
anything else).

See also: PLANT, OEDIT TYPE, OLC OBJECTS, VNUM
#d
"OEDIT POISON"

Usage:  .poison <type>

This sets which type of poison the item contains. Poisons are used by the
Stealth skill tree, and the poison item is lost when it runs out of charges.

Never set a poison type marked with an * (asterisk).

See also: POISON, OEDIT CHARGES, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT POTION"

Usage:  .potion <type>

This sets which type of potion the item contains. Potion items are used up
(removed) when quaffed. Each potion type has a pre-determined effect.

Never set a potion type with an * (asterisk).

See also: POTION, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT POTIONSCALE"

Usage:  .potionscale <number>

This sets the "scale level" of a potion's effects, usually corresponding to a
player level.

For SCALABLE objects, thus number is a scalable value if it is set to a number
other than 0.

Never set a potion type with an * (asterisk).

See also: ITEM SCALING, POTION, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT QUANTITY"

Usage:  .quantity <number>

This sets how many arrows are available from a given ARROW object.

See also: OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT ROOMVNUM"

Usage:  .roomvnum <vnum>

This command sets the target for a portal object. Portals allow players to
travel instantly to another room anywhere in the world. You need a separate
object to represent each end of the portal, as they each target the other's
room. Of course, you can also have one-way portals by only putting an object
on one side.

If you are using the portal in an instanced adventure zone, the target should
be a *room template* vnum, not a real room. When the portal loads, it will be
linked to its instance's version of that room template. Portals cannot link
from the inside of an adventure zone to the outside, or to a room in a
different instance.

If you use the portal in a linking rule of an adventure zone, you don't need
to set the room vnum targets at all. The instance-builder will do that for
you.

See also: OLC ADVENTURES, OLC OBJECTS, OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, PORTAL, VNUM
#d
"OEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION" "OEDIT SHORT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .shortdescription <text>

An object's short description is the text that appears in sentences, and is
shown on many status screens. The name should be reasonably short and simple.
It should not be capitalized unless it contains a proper noun. Names should
always start with "a", "an", or "the" unless it wouldn't make sense in a
sentence.

If an object has a capital letter in its short description, the Reforge and
Refashion abilities will treat it as already "named" and will not allow it to
be renamed.

All of the words in the object name should also appear in the keywords list,
except a/an/the.

Sample names:
 a flaming broadsword
 the chain of doom
 Amerigo's map
 the eye of the Grasper of Apiaries (this one is pushing it for length)

See also: OEDIT KEYWORDS, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT TIMER" "DECAY TIMER" TIMER

Usage:  .timer <hours>

This determines how long an item lasts before it decays and is lost. This can
be used to make any item temporary, but it is used especially on food, drink
containers, portals, and similar. The decay timer only counts down while the
item is in-game, so players who log out do not lose their items. Timers are
measured in game hours/ticks (75 second intervals).

If you set the timer to 0 or -1 in the editor, the item does not decay.

Unlike all other types, when a drink container decays, only its contents go
bad and are poured out.

Food items are usually set to last longer if they are harder to get/make, and
shorter if they are found easily.

Remember, items left on the ground outdoors will decay or bestored after 3
real hours, regardless of their decay timers.

See also: AUTOSTORE, OEDIT TYPE, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT TYPE"

Usage:  .type <type>

An object's type is its main property. This determines how it behaves in the
game, and determines what other properties need to be set for it. When you
change an object's type, some properties (like damage) will be reset to 0.

Never set any type that is marked with an * (asterisk).

Available types:
 UNDEFINED - type not set
 WEAPON - a melee weapon, or a caster weapon (requires .wear WIELD)
 WORN - clothing
 OTHER - miscellaneous
 CONTAINER - a chest, holds items on the ground (never set wear TAKE)
 DRINKCON - a drink container, like a flask
 FOOD - edible
 * - unused
 PORTAL - transports a player to another place (never set .wear TAKE)
 *BOARD - a message board
 CORPSE - a corpse
 COINS - a pile of coins
 *MAIL - a letter
 WEALTH - adds to empire wealth when stored
 *CART - use vehicles instead
 *SHIP - use vehicles instead
 * - unused
 * - unused
 MISSILE_WEAPON - a bow, or similar (requires .wear RANGED)
 ARROW - ammunition for missile weapons
 INSTRUMENT - a musical instrument -- must set custom messages
 SHIELD - for blocking attacks (requires .wear HOLD)
 PACK - expands the player's inventory (requires .wear PACK)
 POTION - gives an effect when quaffed
 POISON - adds an effect to melee combat
 ARMOR - requires certain skills to wear
 BOOK - can be read like a library book

You can get specific help on each of these via HELP <type> ITEM

#d
"OEDIT VALUE0" "OEDIT VALUE1" "OEDIT VALUE2"

Usage:  .value0 <number>
        .value1 <number>
        .value2 <number>

For item type OTHER, you can manually set the three object values. They have
no inherent meaning, but you can use them for scripting with variables like
%obj.val0%. For regular item types, these values are used for things such as
damage, fullness, and capacity.

If you set your OTHER object with the PLANTABLE flag, value1 is replaced by
the 'plants' property. If you can't see the plants property in the editor,
it means your value1 is invalid for planting and you should set your value1
back to 0.

See also: OEDIT PLANTS, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT WEALTH"

Usage:  .wealth <value>

This property determines how much an item adds to an empire's wealth when
stored. It is only available on the WEALTH item type, and usually when you
add storage for the item, you should set the WITHDRAW flag on the storage so
that only people with the correct permission can withdraw it.

See also: OEDIT STORAGE, OLC OBJECTS
#d
"OEDIT WEAPONTYPE" "OEDIT WEAPON TYPE" "WEAPON TYPES" "ATTACK TYPES"

Usage:  .weapontype <type>

The weapon type determines which combat messages are sent, how fast the weapon
attacks in combat, and whether or not it is sharp.

The following weapon types are available:
 1. RESERVED - do not use
 2. slash - sword
 3. slice - axe (used by the chopping chore)
 4. jab - rapier
 5. stab - dagger (used by some Stealth skills)
 6. pound - rock
 7. hammer - hammer (used by the forge command)
 8. whip - whip weapon or tentacle-whip

#d
"OEDIT WEAR"

Usage:  .wear [add | remove] <flags>

The wear flags determine which parts of the body an item can be worn on, as
well as whether or not it can be picked up (TAKE). Be careful how many wear
slots you set, as each one means another copy of the same item can be used
concurrently.

Only items set TAKE can be picked up off the ground.

Weapons can often be set WIELD and HOLD and used in both positions.

Missile weapons must be set RANGED and instruments must be set HOLD.

Wear flags:
   TAKE        FINGER        NECK
   CLOTHES     HEAD          LEGS
   FEET        HANDS         ARMS

"QEDIT COMPLETEMESSAGE" "QEDIT COMPLETE MESSAGE"

Usage:  .completemessage

The complete message is shown to players when they turn in the quest. The
player types the command to turn in the completed quest and sees only this
message.

The message is set in the string editor. You should use /fi to format it
with indent inside the string editor if it's longer than one line (80 chars).

See also: OLC QUESTS, STRING EDITOR
#d
"QEDIT DAILYCYCLE" "QEDIT DAILY CYCLE" "DAILY CYCLE"

Usage:  .dailycycle <number>

When two or more daily quests have the same 'dailycycle' value, only one of
those quests will be available per day, at random. For the sake of cleanliness,
you should pick the vnum of 1 of those quests as the cycle id.

See also: OLC QUESTS, SHOW DAILYCYCLE
#d
"QEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

The quest's description is shown to players when they start the quest, and on
request while they are on the quest. It should describe the quest briefly.

The message is set in the string editor. You should use /fi to format it
with indent inside the string editor if it's longer than one line (80 chars).

See also: OLC QUESTS, STRING EDITOR
#d
"QEDIT FLAGS" "QUEST FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following quest flags are available:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - Mortals cannot see or get the quest.
 REPEAT-PER-INSTANCE - Clears completion when the instance closes.
 EXPIRES-AFTER-INSTANCE - Fails the quest when the instance closes.
 EXTRACT-TASK-OBJECTS - Items and components required for tasks will be lost.
 DAILY - Quest counts as a daily.
 EMPIRE-ONLY - Can only start/finish with mob/room of matching empire (or
    matching not-in-empire).
 NO-GUESTS - Checks actual ownership on the room when you start/finish a quest.

See also: OLC QUESTS, DAILY QUEST
#d
"QEDIT MAXLEVEL" "QEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This controls how high quest rewards can scale. Players can still complete
quests below their level.

See also: OLC QUESTS
#d
"QEDIT MINLEVEL" "QEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This controls what level a player must attain before being able to get this
quest.

See also: OLC QUESTS
#d
"QEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The quest's name should be distinctive, but reasonably short. As a general
rule, it shouldn't be longer than about 40 characters.

See also: OLC QUESTS
#d
"QEDIT REPEAT"

Usage:  .repeat <minutes>
        .repeat never
        .repeat immediately

You can set quests to be repeatable after a certain amount of time. This will
remove the quest from players' completion list, allowing them to pick up the
quest again.

See also: QEDIT PREREQS, QEDIT TASKS, OLC QUESTS
#d
"QEDIT REWARDS"

Usage:  .rewards add <type> <amount> <vnum/type>
        .rewards change <number> vnum <value>
        .rewards copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .rewards remove <number | all>
        .rewards move <number> <up | down>

Quest rewards are given to the player upon completion. You can add as many or
as few rewards as possible, and you can also use quest scripts to give more
complicated rewards instead.

Available reward types:
 BONUS-EXP - Give the player additional bonus exp (expires at end of day).
 COINS - Give the player some coins (empire or misc).
 OBJECT - Give the player items.
 SET-SKILL - Set the player's skill to a specific level (usually 0, 50, 75,
    100). You should use prereqs to be sure what the player's skill is first.
 SKILL-EXP - Give the player some skill experience and a chance for skill gain.
 SKILL-LEVELS - Raise the player's skill level, if possible.
 QUEST-CHAIN - Starts a player on another quest, if they meet the pre-reqs and
    are not already on it.
 REPUTATION - Gain/lose faction reputation.

Note: If you set empire coins as the reward, but the mob is not part of an
empire, the player will receive misc coins instead.

#d
"QEDIT STARTS AT" "QEDIT ENDS AT"

Usage:  .<starts/ends> add <type> <vnum>
        .<starts/ends> change <number> vnum <value>
        .<starts/ends> copy <from type> <from vnum> [starts/ends]
        .<starts/ends> remove <number | all>

You can set the quest givers -- the people/places/things it starts and ends at.
Players can pick up the quest from any of the listed starts, and can turn it in
at any of the listed ends.

Available quest giver types:
 BUILDING - Quest starts in a building/room.
 MOBILE - Quest starts at a given mob.
 OBJECT - Quest starts at a given object (if not bound to someone else).
 ROOM-TEMPLATE - Quest starts at a given room template.
 TRIGGER - Quest is given by a trigger.

NOTE: The "trigger" type is only used for tracking purposes. Unlike the other
types, it won't cause the trigger to automatically offer the quest. Instead,
this indicates that you will use the %quest% command to give or complete the
quest in that trigger.

See also: %QUEST%, OLC QUESTS
#d
"REDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description

All rooms need a good description. The description should be at least 3 full
lines, and should always be formatted with the /fi option in the string
editor. Generally descriptions should not run more than about 6 lines.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, STRING EDITOR
#d
"REDIT EXITS"

Usage:  .exit add <dir> <room template vnum> [keywords if door]
        .exit change <number> <field> <value>
        .exit remove <number | all>

Room templates can exit only to other room templates -- never to real rooms
or world locations. The starting room of an adventure zone will also always
exit back to the place in the world it linked from (if it linked from a
building). Other exits can be added in any direction, or choose RANDOM and a
direction will be chosen for you.

If you wish to create a door that opens and closes, specify door keyword(s) at
the end of the exit add.

You can use 'change' to alter an exit's direction, target, or keywords.
Changing the keywords to 'none' removes the door.

Examples:
 > .exit add random 1234
 > .exit add down 1236 trapdoor door
 
You can use .matchexits to automatically create the exits back to other rooms
that link to the one you're currently editing.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, REDIT MATCH EXITS, VNUM
#d
"REDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

The following room template flags are available:
 OUTDOOR - Affected by sun.
 DARK - Always requires a light. (By default, rooms are dark at night.)
 LIGHT - Never requires a light.
 !MOB - Mobs will not wander into the room (they may still be spawned there).
 PEACEFUL - No combat allowed.
 NEED-BOAT - Requires a boat, swimming, or fly.
 !TELEPORT - Cannot teleport in or out.
 LOOK-OUT - can see the map using "look out"
 !LOCATION - no location shown; disables "where"

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES
#d
"REDIT MATCHEXITS" "REDIT MATCH EXITS"

Usage:  .matchexits

This command will look for other rooms in the same adventure zone that link
to this one, and attempt to create matching exits. This makes the other side
of exits easier to add.

The exit's flags and keywords, if any, are automatically copied.

Matched exits will always lead back in the opposite direction of the exit they
matched (an east exit links back west), unless you are using "random" exits,
in which case they will be random on both sides. When the adventure zone is
instantiated, matching random exits will be linked in the same logical
direction (a random exit linking to a random exit may, for example, go
north-south). They will not end up with wildly different random directions.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, REDIT EXITS
#d
"REDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

The title is shown above the room description. Like all titles, these should
be title-cased (Named Like a Book), should not have punctuation at the end,
and should be a reasonably short description of the room.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES
#d
"REDIT SPAWNS"

Usage:  .spawn add <type> <vnum> <percent> <limit>
        .spawn change <number> <vnum | percent | limit> <value>
        .spawn copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .spawn remove <number | all>

Spawn commands cause any OBJ, MOB, or VEH to load in the room whenever the
adventure zone is reset (if their percent check passes, and there aren't more
than the limit).

The limit is only for the current instance, so setting a limit of 3 means that
each copy of this adventure zone can have 3 of the thing at a time.

This is different from the spawn data set on crops, sectors, and buildings.

See also: OLC ROOM TEMPLATES, ADVEDIT RESET TIME, VNUM
#d
REQUIREMENTS "QEDIT TASKS" "QEDIT PREREQS" "QEDIT PREREQUISITES" "SOCEDIT REQUIREMENTS"

Usage:  .<field> add <type> <vnum> [group]
        .<field> change <number> <amount | group | vnum> <value>
        .<field> copy <from type> <from vnum> [tasks/prereqs]
        .<field> remove <number | all>

Requirement lists are used to determine if a character is eligible for some-
thing, or if they have completed it. Examples include quest prerequisites and
tasks.

A player only needs to meet 1 requirement from the list. However, you can
create requirement groups where all conditions on a group must be met. If
there is more than one group, the player only needs to meet all conditions from
any 1 group. Group names are always a single case-sensitive letter.

Available tasks:
 &cCOMPLETED-QUEST&0 - Must complete a certain quest.
 &cGET-COMPONENT&0 - Must have components.
   Note: If you use multiple component flags, they must be in quotes:
         .requirement add get-component 3 skin "large basic"
         If you want to add a [group], you MUST provide flags even if empty:
         .requirement add get-component 3 skin "" a
 &cGET-OBJECT&0 - Must have items.
 &cKILL-MOB &r*&0&0 - Must kill a certain mob.
 &cKILL-MOB-FLAGGED &r*&0&0 - Must kill mobs with certain flags.
 &cNOT-COMPLETED-QUEST&0 - Has not completed a certain quest.
 &cNOT-ON-QUEST&0 - Is not currently on a certain quest.
 &cOWN-BUILDING&0 - Empire has a certain building.
 &cOWN-VEHICLE&0 - Empire has a certain vehicle.
 &cSKILL-LEVEL-OVER&0 - Player has a certain skill at least this high.
 &cSKILL-LEVEL-UNDER&0 - Player has a certain skill no higher than this.
 &cTRIGGERED &r*&0&0 - Activated by a %quest% command in a trigger.
 &cVISIT-BUILDING &r*&0&0 - Player must go to a certain building/room.
 &cVISIT-ROOM-TEMPLATE &r*&0&0 - Player must go to a certain room template.
 &cVISIT-SECTOR &r*&0&0 - Player must go to a certain terrain.
 &cHAVE-ABILITY&0 - Player must have a certain ability.
 &cREP-OVER&0 - Player must have at least this faction reputation.
 &cREP-UNDER&0 - Player must be at or below this faction reputation.
 &cWEARING&0 - Player has the item equipped
 &cWEARING-OR-HAS&0 - Player has the item either equipped or in inventory
    Note: item will not be extracted even if EXTRACT-TASK-OBJECTS is on

&r*&0 Some types require a trackable quest, and cannot be used as prereqs.

#d
"SECTEDIT BUILDFLAGS"

Usage:  .buildflags [add | remove] <flags>

The buildflags for a sector are checked against the buildon or buildfacing
flags of a building craft recipe, to determine if this sector is a valid place
to build. A building may be built on this sector if at least one flag from its
'buildon' appears in the sector's 'buildflags'.

Available flags:
 water - any type of water tile
 plains - a flat, temperate sector like plains
 mountain - a rough tile like a mountain
 full forest - a temperate forest of various types
 desert - a flat, arid sector
 river - a fresh-water sector
 jungle - any jungle tile
 not player made - DO NOT SET on .buildflags
 ocean - a salt-water tile
 oasis - an arid water source
 crops - any crop tile, should ONLY be used for 'buildfacing'
 grove - an arid forest tile like a desert grove
 swamp - a swamp-type tile
 any forest - a broader category of forests usually used for 'buildfacing'
 open building - does not apply to buildflags -- do not use

Note: When adding these flags to adventure linking rules, they all have to
be added in one line, so you can't type multiple words. Try abbreviating them
to one word, such as: "plains full desert" (the full stands for 'full forest').

See also: CEDIT BUILDON, CEDIT BUILDFACING, OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT COMMANDS"

Usage:  .commands <list>
        .commands none

The commands list is shown below the map, and is meant to help newbies
understand how to use the sector. If the sector can be chopped down, list
'chop' as a command. If it has dig data, put 'dig' in the list.

The commands list is usually put in alphabetic order to look cleaner and less
scattered. The whole list is displayed in cyan, so you should not include any
color codes in the commands list.

For sectors with the CROP flag combined with a crop with the ORCHARD flag,
the orchard command list is shown instead of the default. For all other crops,
the sector's command list is used. For buildings, the commands list from the
building data is used instead.

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT EVOLUTIONS"

Usage:  .evolution add <type> [value] <percent> <becomes sector vnum>
        .evolution change <number> <type | value | percent | sector> <new value>
        .evolution remove <number | all>

This command lets you add or remove an evolution from a sector. Evolutions are
rules that describe how the sector changes over time. Some evolutions change
the world periodically on their own; others are triggered by player action.

No matter how small you set the percentages on evolutions, if they run on their
own, they'll eventually succeed. Percentages may be set from 0.01 to 100.00.
Evolutions are automatically sorted by type and by percentage. Only one will
be called at a time -- the first one whose percentage check passes.

Available types ([value] isn't used unless specified):
 CHOPPED-DOWN - Sector to become when chopped by a player; you should also add
    chop interactions.
 CROP-GROWS - Sector to become when the crop finishes growing (Seeded -> Crop).
 ADJACENT-ONE - Called when this sector is next to a certain other sector
    (value is the sector vnum that it's adjacent to).
 ADJACENT-MANY - Called when this sector is next to at least 6 of another
    sector (value is the sector vnum that it's adjacent to many of).
 RANDOM - Checked periodically and called it if passes.
 TRENCH-START - Sector this one becomes if a person starts to excavate.
 TRENCH-FULL - Sector this one becomes, if it's a trench, when it fills up.
 NEAR-SECTOR - Checked when this sector is within 2 tiles of another sector
    (value is the sector vnum that must be nearby).
 PLANTS-TO - Sector this one becomes when you start to plant a crop on it.
 MAGIC-GROWTH - Sector this one becomes if it is magically forced to grow.
 NOT-ADJACENT - No matching sector within 1 tile (value is the sector vnum).
 NOT-NEAR-SECTOR - No matching sector within 2 tiles (value is the sector
    vnum).
 

Examples:
 Jungle: .evolution add CHOPPED-DOWN 1 50% 28
 Jungle: .evolution add CHOPPED-DOWN 1 100% 27
 Plains: .evolution add ADJACENT-MANY 4 .02% 1

#d
"SECTEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Available sector flags:
 LOCK-ICON - a random icon is chosen when the terrain changes to this, and kept
 IS-ADVENTURE - used only for adventure rooms
 NON-ISLAND - won't be detected as part of an island by the island detection
    system.
 CHORE - This sector may have a chore (required, or the chore will never trigger)
 !CLAIM - Cannot be claimed.
 START-LOCATION - A starting location for players; prevents combat here
 FRESH-WATER - Requires a boat, counts as a river
 OCEAN - Requires a boat, counts as ocean
 DRINK - Provides drinkable water; can also be used from adjacent rooms
 HAS-CROP-DATA - Has an associated crop (like a seeded field or a crop tile)
 CROP - Is a crop (visually replaced by crop data); you should also set HAS-CROP-DATA
 LAY-ROAD - The lay command here can be used to create a road
 IS-ROAD - This tile is a road
 CAN-MINE - The tile is mine-able; this allows the Prospect ability
 SHOW-ON-POLITICAL-MAPOUT - Still appears on the political version of the graphical map
 MAP-BUILDING - This sector represents a building on the map; shown using building data
 INSIDE-ROOM - This sector represents an interior (designated) ROOM building
 LARGE-CITY-RADIUS - This tile counts as in-city much further away than normal
 OBSCURE-VISION - Players can't be seen here; also blocks guard towers
 IS-TRENCH - Sector counts as a trench and fills with water
 * - unused
 ROUGH - This is rough, raised terrain, like a mountain
 SHALLOW-WATER - The tile has water but requires no boat (like a swamp)

#d
"SECTEDIT ICONS" "CROPEDIT ICONS"

Usage:  .icons add <type> <color code> <icon>
        .icons copy <from type> <from vnum>
        .icons change <number> <type | color | icon> <value>
        .icons remove <number | all>

EmpireMUD uses four different seasons and the biggest change between them is
that sectors look different at different times of year. You can also specify
an icon for ANY season. The <type> parameter is where you specify which season,
and a list of valid types is shown on the olc display for the sector.

If more than one icon is available for a given season (or from season + any),
one is chosen at random. If you want to have random icons available, but want
one pre-selected, set the LOCK-ICON sector flag. Be warned, however, that once
an icon is locked, it remains the same in any season.

For icons, the base color is separate from the icon, so the icon does not
need to start with a color code (unless it's different from the base you set).
You can also use the &&? color code to specify the base color.

The olc editor display shows the rendered (colored) icon, its base color code,
and then the icon with raw, unrendered && codes.

See additional info at HELP SPECIAL ICONS.

Example:
 > .icon add summer &&g .&&0[]&&?.

#d
"SECTEDIT MOVECOST" "SECTEDIT MOVE COST" "SECTEDIT MOVEMENT COST"

Usage:  .movecost <number>

Each sector has a movement cost when a player enters or leaves it. You can
look at other existing sectors for an idea of what an appropriate cost is.

The cost for a player to move from one sector to another is the average of the
costs of those two sectors. Open buildings have a cost that is the average of
their current sector (building) and the sector they were built upon (e.g.
mountain).

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The sector name is generally one word (sometimes two), singular (Hill not
Hills), and capitalized. It's important that it doesn't conflict with the
name of another sector, so you should try to make them unique. Sometimes, this
just means adding a second word to the name ("Sandy Trench" vs "Trench").

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT ROADSIDEICON" "ROADSIDEICON" "ROADSIDE ICON" "ROAD SIDE ICON"

Usage:  .roadsideicon <character>

The roadside icon is a single-character icon that's used when map tiles are
built around things like roads. This should be a single character that looks
reasonably like the whole sector tile. It does not include a color code -- it
will use the color code of the full icon that would otherwise be displayed.

Examples:
 Plains (....): .
 Forest (^^^^): ^
 Mountain (/\/\): ^

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
"SECTEDIT TITLE"

Usage:  .title <title>

The title is shown above the map on most sectors (except sectors which are
buildings or crops, where the title comes from one of those instead). Like all
titles, these should be title-cased (Named Like a Book), should not have
punctuation at the end, and should be a reasonably short description of the
sector.

See also: OLC SECTORS
#d
SKILLEDIT "OLC SKILLS" "SKILL OLC"

Usage:  .skill <command>
        .command

The .olc skill editor allows you to set up player skills. The main purpose of
this is to choose which abilities that skill unlocks, and at what level. This
does not control what class a player becomes (see HELP CLASSEDIT), only which
powers they have access to and in which order.

All commands in the editor arg highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these commands by typing &yHELP SKILLEDIT <COMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
> .skill edit 123
> .name Test Skill
> .save

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

See also: OLC, OLC ABORT, OLC EDIT, OLC EDITOR, OLC SAVE
#d
"SKILLEDIT ABBREVIATION"

Usage:  .abbrev <string>

The skill abbreviation is a short name used for some strings where there isn't
enough space for the full name. It must always be 3 letters and contain no
color codes.

See also: OLC SKILLS
#d
"SKILLEDIT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .description <text>

Skill descriptions are short phrases that appear when a player types "skills",
or when they get more info on a skill during character creation. These should
always be short -- 40 characters or so. Generally they are written as whole
sentences, but with no punctuation.

See also: OLC SKILLS
#d
"SKILLEDIT FLAGS" "SKILL FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Skill flags set various properties on skills.

Available flags:
 IN-DEVELOPMENT - Players can't see or gain the skill.

See also: OLC SKILLS, OLC REMOVEINDEV
#d
"SKILLEDIT MAXLEVEL" "SKILLEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This is the maximum level the skill can go up to. Normally, it is set to 100.
However, you can also limit skills to 50 or 75, to create "minor skill trees".

You can choose numbers other than 50 or 75, but setting the maximum to 80
would still require the player to specialize past 75.

See also: OLC SKILLS
#d
"SKILLEDIT MINDROP" "SKILLEDIT MIN DROP" "SKILLEDIT MIN DROP LEVEL"

Usage:  .mindrop <level>

This is the lowest a player can voluntarily "skill drop" the skill to. For
example, the Vampire skill has a min-drop of 1 because the player can't get
rid of his vampire status this way.

See also: OLC SKILLS
#d
"SKILLEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

A skill's name is what players see on their skill list, and what is shown in
many messages related to the skill. Skill names should be reasonably short and
very unique. Players will want to abbreviate them easily.

See also: OLC SKILLS
#d
"SKILLEDIT TREE"

Usage:  .tree add <ability> <level> [requires ability]
        .tree remove <ability | all>
        .tree change <ability> <level | requires> <new value>

This command allows you to set up the skill tree -- the abilities players can
purchase. Each ability requires a level. You can also set a requirement that
they buy another ability first -- that's what makes it a tree.

Each ability may only be assigned to only one skill, and cannot be assigned to
both a skill and a class.

Players always get a fixed number of ability points in a skill, and you can
use the level and prerequisite abilities to help control how many of the
abilities a player can access.

See also: ABILITY POINTS, OLC SKILLS, VNUM
#d
"SPECIAL ICONS" "ICON CODES"

The following special codes may be used in icons:
 @. - show the roadside icon for the base tile type here
 @e - show the roadside icon for the tile to the east
 @w - show the roadside icon for the tile to the west
 @u - show a 'v' if the tile to the west is a wall
 @U - show a 'V' if the tile to the west is a wall
 @v - show a 'v' if the tile to the east is a wall
 @V - show a 'V' if the tile to the east is a wall

The following special colors may be used in icons:
 &&? - The tile color of the base terrain.
 &&# - Wall color (walls are colored by enchantments).
#d
SOCEDIT "OLC SOCIALS" "SOCIAL OLC" "SOCIAL EDITOR"

Usage:  .soc <command>
        .<command>

The .olc social editor is a tool for creating and editing social commands
(which are like pre-set emotes). It provides a simple in-game menu with
contextual choices to design all types of socials.

All commands in the editor are highlighted in yellow and placed inside <angle
braces>. You can get help on these by typing &yHELP SOCEDIT <COMMMAND>&0.

You can close an open editor with .abort or .save.

Example:
 > .soc edit 10199
 > .name smile (with mask)
 > .command smile
 > .save

For notes on the mud's building rules, see HELP BUILDING GUIDE.

See also: OLC, OLC ABORT, OLC EDIT, OLC EDITOR, OLC SAVE
#d
"SOCEDIT COMMAND"

Usage:  .command <word>

This is the command which is typed to use the social. It must be one single
word (usually a verb), as any additional words would be interpreted as a
target.

Social commands never override regular game commands.

If more than one social has the same command, the one with the most matched
requirements will be used. If a player qualifies for two copies of a social
that have the same number of requirements, one is chosen at random.

See also: OLC SOCIALS
#d
"SOCEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Social flags are properties that affect how the social behaves.

Available flags:
 IN-DEV - Cannot be used by mortals.
 HIDE-IF-INVIS - No messages are shown to the room if the actor is not visible.
   (this is normally used for socials that are visual but silent, like 'smile')

See also: OLC SOCIALS
#d
"SOCEDIT MESSAGES" "SOCEDIT N2CHARACTER" "SOCEDIT N2OTHERS" "SOCEDIT S2CHARACTER" "SOCEDIT S2OTHERS" "SOCEDIT T2CHARACTER" "SOCEDIT T2VICTIM" "SOCEDIT T2OTHERS" "SOCEDIT TNOTFOUND"

Usage:  .n2char <message | none>
        .<type> <message | none>

These messages are the ones shown when the player uses the social. Some
messages are optional and may be left blank.

Messages when a social is typed without an argument ("grin"):
  No-arg to character <&yn2char&0>
  No-arg to others <&yn2other&0>  - leave blank if n2char is an error message
    about needing a target

Messages when a social is typed with an argument ("grin Gaia"):
  Targeted to character <&yt2char&0>  - this whole section may be blank
  Targeted to others <&yt2other&0>
  Targeted to victim <&yt2vict&0>
  Target not found <&ytnotfound&0>  - sent to the actor when target is invalid

Messages when the actor targets himself ("grin self"):
  Target-self to character <&ys2char&0>  - may be blank
  Target-self to others <&ys2other&0>  - may be blank (s2char must be blank)

See &cHELP DOLLAR SIGN CODES&0 for a list of codes that can be used in socials:
  $n, $m, $e, $s - used for the actor
  $N, $M, $E, $s - used for the target (targeted strings only)

See also: OLC SOCIALS
#d
"SOCEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

The social name is text used internally, to distinguish between different
socials that share the same command. Players don't see the names of socials.

Examples:
 - Smile
 - Smile with Mask
 - Fangy Vampire Smile

See also: OLC SOCIALS
#d
"STRING EDITOR" "TEXT EDITOR" "STRING EDITING" ,

Note: If you are using the string editor in-game, you must begin commands with
a comma (,). Only text you type starting with a , will be added to the string.
You can enter full-string-edit mode using ,/, (or turn that mode off the same
way).

The string editor is used to edit player descriptions, board messages, mail
letters, and more. You can type '/h' inside the string editor for a list of
its commands.

When the string editor opens, it shows you the contents of the string and
then gives a ] prompt. You are inserting text on a new line at the end of the
existing string. You can type '/l' to see the current string at any time.

TIP: If your string is longer than 80 characters (normal telnet window width),
use '/fi' to format it with indentation. This puts the whole thing into a
single paragraph, indented 3 spaces, with each line no longer than 80
characters.
#
"TRIGEDIT ARGUMENTS"

Usage:  .arguments <string>

This feature allows you to pass string arguments to the script.

See also: OLC TRIGGERS, TRIGEDIT NUMARG
#d
"TRIGEDIT ATTACHES"

Usage:  .attaches <type>

This determines what type of thing the trigger is meant to attach to. A trigger
that was designed for a mob probably wouldn't work very well attached to an
object.

The attach type also determines which event types you can choose.

You can find help files for different triggers at: &yMTRIG&0, &yOTRIG&0, &yRTRIG&0, &yVTRIG&0

See also: OLC TRIGGERS, TRIGEDIT TYPES
#d
"TRIGEDIT COMMANDS" TRIGEDIT-COMMANDS TRIG-COMMANDS TRIGGER-COMMANDS TRIGEDIT-COMMANDLISTS

Usage:  .commands

The "commands" section is the body of the script: the set of commands that will
run when the trigger fires. It can include statements like "if", variables,
and other scripting functions.

The commands are edited in the text editor. When you're done editing the
commands, you should format them with /f -- this will clean up the code, as
well as check it to help make sure it will run safely.

See also: MTRIG COMMANDS, OTRIG COMMANDS, RTRIG COMMANDS, VTRIG COMMANDS
See also: SCRIPT COMMANDS, OLC TRIGGERS, TEXT EDITOR
#d
"TRIGEDIT FULLSEARCH"

Usage:  .t fullsearch -<field> <argument> <...>

This command allows you to search for triggers matching certain criteria. You
can specify multiple fields if you want. Any leftover arguments are matched to
the trigger's name and command text.

Fields:
  &c-attaches&0 - see HELP TRIGEDIT ATTACHES
  &c-type&0 - see HELP MTRIG TYPES, etc.

Examples:
 > .t fullsearch -type Random -type Global
 > .t fullsearch i11234
 > .t fullsearch %force%
#d
"TRIGEDIT NAME"

Usage:  .name <name>

A trigger's name should be short and descriptive. This name is shown in many
lists, including the list of scripts when editing a mob or object.

Examples:
 > Cow behavior
 > Mob Fight - fireballs
 > Hestian Trinket recall

See also: OLC TRIGGERS
#d
"TRIGEDIT NUMARG" "TRIGEDIT NUMERIC ARGUMENT"

Usage:  .numarg <number>

The numeric argument (numarg) is a number that is passed to the script when
it runs.

See also: OLC TRIGGERS
#d
"TRIGEDIT TYPES" TRIGEDIT-TYPES TRIGGER-LIST TRIGGER-TYPES TRIG-TYPES

Usage:  .types [add | remove] <flags>

You can set trigger types this way. These determine which events will set off
the script. The available types are determined by what the trigger attaches to.

See also: MTRIG TYPES, OTRIG TYPES, RTRIG TYPES, VTRIG TYPES
See also: OLC TRIGGERS, TRIGEDIT ATTACHES
#d
"#n" "#e" "#a"

Mob names can use certain special codes in order to dynamically add names.
You can use these codes in the short description, long description, and
keywords.

- #n  Pick a random name from the chosen nameset. If the gender is left neutral,
      it will also pick a random gender.

- #e  Empire name. For this to work, you need to set the mob as a claimed-only
      spawn on the map.

- #a  Empire adjective. See notes on #e.

See also: MEDIT NAMESET
#d
"ARMOR ITEM" "ARMOR OBJECT"

The ARMOR item type is similar to WORN, except that it requires specific
abilities to use it. Armor items may be set to any wear locations, but there
is a worn-as-armor slot that must always be this item type. Armor items will
scale higher than non-armor items.

Mage armor is for casters and healers.

Light armor is for melee damage characters and should give damage traits.

Medium armor is for PVP or solo adventuring, and should give both DPS and
   tank traits on the same item.

Heavy armor should always include -WITS, -STRENGTH, or other melee penalties.
   It should only include tank traits otherwise.
#d
"ARROW ITEM" "ARROW OBJECT"

The ARROW item type is used to create stacks of ammunition for the MISSILE
WEAPON type. Its damage is added to the missile weapon's own damage. Arrows
normally come in stacks of 10 and are named as "a quiver of arrows".

If the arrow is scalable, its damage bonus will scale. Applies don't matter on
arrow items because they are not equipped. Arrows only fire out of the player's
inventory.
#d
"BOARD ITEM" "BOARD OBJECT"

The BOARD item type is used only for in-game boards and cannot be set in OLC
because boards require code support as well.
#d
"BOOK ITEM" "BOOK OBJECT"

The BOOK type is used along with the bookedit interface and EmpireMUD's library
system. You can spawn books in adventures by writing them in the book editor,
then assigning their book ID to a book object in your adventure zone. The
data from the book editor will override your short description, long desc-
ription, and look description.
#d
"COINS ITEM" "COINS OBJECT"

The COINS type represents a pile of coins and will be converted from an object
to "real" coins when a player picks it up. Coins dropped by adventures should
always be "miscellaneous coins" rather than the coins of a specific empire, as
adventures should not rely on empires continuing to exist.

If your coin item is scalable, the coin value will be set by the scaling system
based on the player's level.

This should not be confused with the WEALTH item type.
#d
"CONTAINER ITEM" "CONTAINER OBJECT"

EmpireMUD does not use containers with the TAKE flag. These items should only
be used on the ground. If you want to raise inventory capacity, use the PACK
item type instead.

If you want to make a cart (or other movable container), use a vehicle instead.
#d
"CORPSE ITEM" "CORPSE OBJECT"

EmpireMUD does not currently allow content builders to add actual corpse
objects. You can use the CONTAINER item type if you don't set it as take-able,
or else you can use OTHER but won't be able to put items inside the corpse.

This item type itself is reserved for code use.
#d
"DRINKCON ITEM" "DRINKCON OBJECT" "DRINK ITEM" "DRINK OBJECT" "DRINK CONTAINER ITEM" "DRINK CONTAINER OBJECT"

This type represents two different things:

Some drink containers are kept in the player's inventory, like a canteen or
a cup. These should be relatively small in size, and you can set your item as
scalable in order to automatically determine how many drinks it will hold.

Other drink containers are like fountains, as no-take objects in the room
which can provide very large amounts of liquid to players. These shouldn't
be scalable, and you can set the capacity as high as you like.
#d
"FOOD ITEM" "FOOD OBJECT"

The FOOD item type represents something edible which will sustain the player.
Usually food will be higher level, with a longer timer and mour hours of full-
ness, only if it's harder to make or acquire. Simple foods received from the
forage or pick command should be short-lived and low-fullness no matter what
they represent. Something that takes several ingredients and a Trade ability
could last much longer.
#d
"INSTRUMENT ITEM" "INSTRUMENT OBJECT"

The INSTRUMENT item type can be used with the "play" command, and you must be
able to HOLD the instrument to do this.

You need to set at least one 'instrument-to-char' and one 'instrument-to-room'
custom message for the item. You can set more if you like, and each one will
be displayed randomly every few action ticks.

See also: OEDIT CUSTOM
#d
"MAIL ITEM" "MAIL OBJECT"

The MAIL item type is used internally and can't be set in builder-created items
or adventures. However, you can use the OTHER type with a look-description or
extra-description to get the same effect.
#d
"MISSILE WEAPON ITEM" "MISSILE WEAPON OBJECT"

The MISSILE WEAPON item type represents a bow, crossbow, or similar item. It
should always have the RANGED wear slot only, never wield or hold. In order to
use weapons of this type, players must also have matching ARROW items in their
inventory.

If the missile weapon is scalable, it will scale its own damage bonus.
#d
"OTHER ITEM" "OTHER OBJECT"

This is used for items that don't have another applicable type. It has no
base requirements to use it, and can represent almost anything. This type also
gives you access to edit the object's 3 generic values, which may be useful
for scripting.
#d
"PACK ITEM" "PACK OBJECT"

The PACK item type is used to increase how much players can carry. You should
always combine it with the PACK wear location, because it has no function in
any other slot.

Pack sizes are scalable, and you can also set various applies on the pack to
divert its scaling points to something other than inventory size. Like all
scaling options, the capacity and the applies will scale in proportion to
each other.

If you want items in other slots to add inventory capacity, use the INVENTORY
apply instead.
#d
"POISON ITEM" "POISON OBJECT"

The POISON item is applied on successful weapon attacks. Each player may only
have one active poison at a time.

Each time a poison is applied to a target, the poison object loses 1 charge,
until it is used up and discarded completely.
#d
"PORTAL ITEM" "PORTAL OBJECT"

Portals allow players to enter them and transport them from place to place.
You can use portals in several ways:

Adventures can use portals as their entrance/exit. You don't have to set a
target room on these, as it will be set when the adventure instance spawns.

You can create fixed portals inside of your adventures. In this case, use the
room template that the portal leads to as its target, instead of a live world
vnum.

You could also spawn portals using scripts. In this case, you should usually
set the portal's destination using the script that spawns it.
#d
"POTION ITEM" "POTION OBJECT"

Potions choose their effect from a pre-existing list. Some potion types, but
not all, can be scaled using the potionscale trait.

If you don't set your potion as scalable, you can manually set the potionscale
to a level to get that level of healing/etc.

If you do set your potion as scalable, you only need to set the potionscale to
1 and it will scale to the correct level.

Potions can only be used once, and then are lost.
#d
"RESOURCE ACTIONS" "RESOURCE ACTION TYPES"

Resource lists (like buildings and vehicles) can include "actions", which add
flavor to construction and take time, but don't cost anything. These will only
be visible for things that build over time (like buildings, maintenance,
vehicles, and repair) -- not things that take resources instantly (like forge).

Available resource actions are:
  dig
  clear terrain
  tidy up
  repair
  scout area
  block water
  engrave
  magic words
  organize

See also: BEDIT RESOURCE, CEDIT RESOURCES, VEDIT RESOURCE
#d
"SHIELD ITEM" "SHIELD OBJECT"

The SHIELD item type always needs the HOLD wear location, and in most cases it
should have the BLOCK apply set. Shields that don't have any BLOCK will be
ineffective at blocking, although this may be a desired effect.

Shields can only be used by players with the correct Battle ability and they
are primarily for tank characters, since they use up the off-hand hold slot.

If you want an off-hand item for casters, consider type OTHER.
#d
"SHIP ITEM" "SHIP OBJECT"

The SHIP item type represents large ships with interiors, which are piloted
around on water tiles by players inside. These cannot be built in OLC because
they still require code support to spawn them correctly. Future versions of
EmpireMUD will change this by using scripts to set up the interior; it is not
currently an option.
#d
"UNDEFINED ITEM" "UNDEFINED OBJECT"

The UNDEFINED item type should not be used for live items. If you need a
generic item, use type OTHER.
#d
"VEDIT ANIMALSREQUIRED" "VEDIT ANIMALS REQUIRED"

Usage:  .animalsrequired <number>

This is the number of animals that can be harnessed to the vehicle. Players
cannot drag, lead, or drive a vehicle that doesn't have enough animals attached
to it.

See also: HARNESS, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT CAPACITY"

Usage:  .capacity <number>

Vehicle capacity is used for both container storage, and for the amount moved
by the shipping system -- depending on which flags are set on the vehicle. It
has no purpose if you don't set either CONTAINER or SHIPPING. If the vehicle
has both flags, the shipping system will be limited by how many items are
stored in the vehicle as a container.

The capacity is measured in item size -- most items count as 1, except LARGE
items which count as 2. Items with other items inside of them count as the
total of all items inside.

See also: VEDIT FLAGS, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT DESIGNATE" "DESIGNATE FLAGS"

Usage:  .designate [add | remove] <flags>

Designate flags control what types of rooms may be added to a vehicle. This
only matters if the "extra rooms" property is set greater than 0 AND the
"interior room" property is set.

Rooms can be designated in vehicles that have a matching designate flag with
the room. If a room without a matching designate flag is somehow added to the
vehicle (for example, as the "interior room" or via a trigger), players will
not be able to change that room with redesignate.

See HELP DESIGNATE FLAGS for a list of valid flags.

See also: VEDIT EXTRA ROOMS, VEDIT INTERIOR ROOM, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT EXTRAROOMS" "VEDIT EXTRA ROOMS"

Usage:  .extrarooms <number>

If this number is greater than 0, players may use the 'designate' command to
add additional rooms to the inside of the vehicle, with options based on what
you set with the '.designate' olc option.

Players will only be able to add these rooms if they can get inside the
vehicle, which means you MUST also set the '.interiorroom' property.

See also: VEDIT DESIGNATE, VEDIT INTERIOR ROOM, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT FLAGS"

Usage:  .flags [add | remove] <flags>

Flags let you specify certain properties about the vehicle. Many different
types of vehicles can be constructed this way.

Available flags:
 *INCOMPLETE - vehicle is not fully constructed (triggered by crafting)
 DRIVING - vehicle moves on land**
 SAILING - vehicle moves on water**
 FLYING - vehicle moves through the air**
 ALLOW-ROUGH - drag/drive work on rough terrain (e.g. mountains)
 SIT - player can sit on the vehicle
 IN - changes text from "on" to "in", and "aboard" to "inside"
 BURNABLE - can be burnt using the "light" command
 CONTAINER - items can be placed inside
 SHIPPING - can be used by the shipping system
 CUSTOMIZABLE - allows "customize vehicle"
 DRAGGABLE - players can move it on land with "drag"
 !BUILDING - cannot be dragged/driven into a building (e.g. too large)
 CAN-PORTAL - can be dragged/driven/led through portals
 LEADABLE - can be pulled around with the "lead" command
 CARRY-VEHICLES - vehicles can be put inside (usually via drag/lead)
 CARRY-MOBS - mobs can be put inside (usually via lead)
 SIEGE-WEAPONS - can fire on buildings and vehicles
 ON-FIRE - currently burning (via the "light" command)
 !LOAD-ONTO-VEHICLE - cannot be loaded onto another vehicle
 VISIBLE-IN-DARK - can be seen at night without a light

** The DRIVING/SAILING/FLYING flags each enable specific commands for moving
the vehicle. If it has more than one of these, each command will work. Usually
each of these flags enables a certain set of terrain, but vehicles with more
than one of these flags can be moved on any valid terrain with any of those
commands.

See also: OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT HITPOINTS" "VEDIT HEALTH"

Usage:  .hitpoints <value>

This number is how much damage a vehicle can take from a catapult or other
sources, before it is destroyed.

Vehicles like catapults deal 8 damage per 100 levels, per shot. Siege rituals
deal Intelligence + 1 damage. You can determine how many hitpoints to give a
building based on this.

Any damage over 10% of a vehicle's health will also add "1 year" of required
maintenance to the vehicle (or nails, if the vehicle requires no yearly work).
The repair command can be used to restore hitpoints.

Common hitpoint levels:
 furniture: 1 (if it requires no maintenance)
 small cart: 5
 large cart: 25
 small ship: 32
 medium ship: 96
 large ship: 128

See also: VEDIT YEARLY MAINTENANCE, FIRE, OLC VEHICLES, REPAIR, SIEGE RITUAL
#d
"VEDIT ICON"

Usage:  .icon <icon | none>

Vehicles usually don't appear on the world map, but they can be set to do so by
giving them an icon. In general, vehicle icons can lead to map clutter and
should be avoided. However, they can help players find ships or other large
vehicles on the map. Users in screen-reader mode will see the vehicle's name
next to the tile name, instead of its icon.

If more than one vehicle is in the same room, only the first vehicle in the
list is shown on the map (this is generally the last vehicle that entered the
room).

You should almost always start the icon with &&0 to clear the tile's base
color. There is no need to put a &&0 at the end of the icon.

Examples:
 > .icon &&0<&&u44&&0>

See also: COLOR, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT INTERIORROOM" "VEDIT INTERIOR ROOM"

Usage:  .interiorroom <vnum | none>

This sets the room (actually, building) vnum that is used for the interior of
the vehicle. It must be a "building" (.b editor) with the ROOM flag, and cannot
be an adventure's room template.

If the interior room has the LOOK-OUT flag, players will see the world map
above the room description, and the room title will appear as the exterior room
rather than the one the player is standing in. In this case, the description
of the interior room should be short.

This property must be set for a player to be able to board/enter the vehicle.

See also: OLC BUILDINGS, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT KEYWORDS"

Usage:  .keywords <keywords>

This command updates the keywords on a vehicle. The keywords are a list of
single words that can be used to target it. It should include any words from
the short or long description that identify the vehicle.

Usually the most significant keyword should be first. This keyword is retained
when the vehicle is renamed by players.

Example:
 name: a cart
 long description: A rickety cart is parked here
 keywords: cart rickety

See also: VEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION, VEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT LONGDESCRIPTION" "VEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .longdescription <string>

The long description is the text you see when the vehicle is in the room. Its
name should appear somewhere near the beginning, and the rest should be a
complete sentence indicating that it is present.

Examples:
A cart is parked here.
A ship is floating in the water.

See also: VEDIT KEYWORDS, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT LOOKDESCRIPTION" "VEDIT LOOK DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .lookdescription

The look description is shown when a player looks at or examines the vehicle.
This can be any length, but "newbie" vehicles should include information on how
to use them.

The look description is set in the string editor. If it is less than 80
characters long, it will fit on one line and should not be indented. If it
goes any longer than that, you should use /fi to format it with indent inside
the string editor.

See also: OLC VEHICLES, STRING EDITOR
#d
"VEDIT MAXLEVEL" "VEDIT MAX LEVEL"

Usage:  .maxlevel <level>

This command determines the maximum level a vehicle will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear.

If you set the maxlevel to 0, there will be no maximum and the vehicle can
scale to any level over the minimum.

See also: VEDIT MINLEVEL, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT MINLEVEL" "VEDIT MIN LEVEL"

Usage:  .minlevel <level>

This command determines the minimum level a object will scale to. Players are
rated from level 1 to 100 based on their skills, plus a number based on their
gear.

If you set the minlevel to 0, there will be no lower limit and the vehicle can
scale to any level under the maximum.

See also: VEDIT MAXLEVEL, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT MOVETYPE" "VEDIT MOVE TYPE"

Usage:  .movetype <type>

The move type determines what message is sent when the vehicle moves. The same
message is sent regardless of which movement command (drive, sail, pilot) is
used.

The same list of move types is used for mobs, so some types may not be
appropriate for vehicles.

See also: OLC VEHICLES
#d
"VEDIT RESOURCES" "VEDIT YEARLY MAINTENANCE"

Usage:  .resource add <type> <amount> <vnum/name> [flags, for components only]
        .resource change <number> <quantity | vnum | name | flags> <value>
        .resource remove <number | all>
        .resource move <number> <up | down>

This command adds materials to the vehicle's "yearly maintenance" list. These
are resources needed to maintain the vehicle each year. If you don't set any,
then the vehicle does not require maintenance.

This uses the ".resource" command to be consistent with other editors, but
these are not the resources needed to build the vehicle in the first place --
only to repair it.

If a vehicle takes damage from any source, and that damage is more than 10% of
its hitpoints, it will also add the yearly-maintenance resources to the repair
cost.

Vehicles with only 1 hitpoint will never get their yearly maintenance cost, as
even 1 year of decay will destroy them.

See HELP OLC RESOURCES for more information.

See also: VEDIT HITPOINTS, OLC VEHICLES, REPAIR, RESOURCE ACTIONS
#d
"VEDIT SHORTDESCRIPTION" "VEDIT SHORT DESCRIPTION"

Usage:  .shortdescription <string>

The 'short description' is the trait that's shown in lists, in action messages,
and almost everywhere else except when a player types 'look' in the room (where
the long description is shown instead). This should be short, should generally
begin with a/an/the unless it's a proper noun, and should not be capitalized
(again unless it's a proper noun).

Examples:
 the cart
 a carriage
 the Enterprise

See also: VEDIT KEYWORDS, VEDIT LONG DESCRIPTION, OLC VEHICLES
#d
"WEALTH ITEM" "WEALTH OBJECT"

The WEALTH type represents an object of value. These are not converted to money
like the COINS type is, but they can be minted into coins by players with a
mint. Wealth items contribute to an empire's total wealth when they are stored.

This item type has no effect unless the item is stored in normal storage.
#d
"WEAPON ITEM" "WEAPON OBJECT"

The WEAPON item type covers melee/caster weapons.

Notes:
- You should almost always set .wear WIELD.
- Small weapons, like daggers and swords, can also be .wear HOLD -- players
  will be able to use a second copy of the weapon in their hold slot, and
  may be able to attack with it in that slot if they have Dual Wield.
- The TWO-HANDED flag gives a weapon more scaling points and requires both
  hands, but only high-level players will be able to use it. Nobody below
  skill level 100 will have the correct ability.
- You must set the .weapontype property.
- You should set the .damage property to at least 1. If your item is scalable,
  this trait will scale along with the applies.
- Players usually prefer to enchant their own weapons, so you may wish to
  avoid pre-enchanted ones.
- The SLOW and FAST flags affect the rate of attack, but neither is really a
  bonus or penalty. They just help create more weapon diversity.
#d
"WORN ITEM" "WORN OBJECT"

The WORN item type is for clothing (not armor). There are no requirements to
use clothing and it usually isn't used to give apply bonuses, although shoes
and some other worn items are an exception to this.

If you are going to use the worn-as-armor wear location, or are planning to
give the item good stats, you should usually be using the ARMOR item type
instead.
#d
"DOLLAR SIGN CODES" "DOLLARSIGN CODES" $$ $$n $$e $$v $$m $$p $$o $$p $$v

EmpireMUD uses the so-called dollar sign codes in a function called act(),
which is used to send action text to people in the game. Usually this only
appears in the code itself, but there are a few places where players encounter
it -- such as emotes and custom object messages.

Player variables:
 $n - actor's name                      $N - 2nd person's name
 $o - actor's real name                 $O - 2nd person's real name
 $e - he/she/it for the actor           $E - he/she/it for 2nd person
 $m - him/her/it for the actor          $M - him/her/it for 2nd person
 $s - his/her/its for the actor         $S - his/her/its for 2nd person

Item variables:
 $p - short desc for the 1st item       $P - short desc for the 2nd item
 $a - a/an for the 1st item             $A - a/an for the 2nd item

Vehicle variables:
 $v - short desc for the 1st vehicle (in the code, requires ACT_VEHICLE_OBJ)
 $V - short desc for the 2nd vehicle

Misc variables (code only):
 $t - The obj parameter as a string
 $T - The vict_obj parameter as a string
 $F - The first word of a string passed to the vict_obj parameter
#d
$~
