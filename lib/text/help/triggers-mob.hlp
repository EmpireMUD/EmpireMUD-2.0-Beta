"ACT TRIGGER" "MTRIG ACT" TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACT TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACTION

Act (mob trigger)

Argument type:  the phrase (whole string) or word list to match

The Act trigger occurs when someone performs a matching action in the same room
as the mob who has the trigger. It can match either a phrase (which must be
contained in the action text), or match any word from a word list.

Note: Act triggers can only match things passed through the code's act()
   function, which includes MOST game text that gets sent to the room. If you
   find that you can't get a trigger to respond to action text, consult a
   programmer about looking into how that text is being sent.
Note: Act triggers attached to charmed mobs will not fire unless the trigger
   also has the Charmed type.

Variables:
  &c%actor%&0 - The character causing the trigger to activate.
  &c%victim%&0 - The character, if any, on the receiving end of the action.
  &c%object%&0 - The object, if any, used in the action.
  &c%target%&0 - The target object of the action, if any.
  &c%arg%&0 - The entire action phrase that was seen.

"BRIBE TRIGGER" "MTRIG BRIBE" TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE

Bribe (mob trigger)

Argument type:  minimum number of misc coins given to the mobile

Bribe is triggered when a person gives coins to the mob. The type of coin is
not considered, because all coinage is made by players and has different
values. Only the number of coins matters.

Note: Bribe triggers attached to charmed mobs will not fire unless the trigger
   also has the Charmed type.

Variables:
  &c%actor%&0 - The character providing coins to the mobile.
  &c%amount%&0 - Number of coins given.

See also: MTRIG CHARMED
#d
"CHARMED TRIGGER" "MTRIG CHARMED" TRIGEDIT-MOB-CHARMED

Charmed (mob trigger type)

The 'Charmed' trigger type modifies other types like Fight and Random, to
allow them to trigger even if the mob is charmed.

This is useful for mobs that are designed as companions or familiars. Most
adventure mobs shouldn't use triggers while charmed, though, because players
may find a way to abuse them.

Affected trigger types are: Fight, Random, Memory, Greet, Entry, Command,
   Speech, Act, Hitprcnt, Receive, Death, Bribe, Ability, Leave, and Door.

See also: MTRIG FIGHT, MTRIG RANDOM
#d

Death (mob trigger)

Argument type:  percent chance to execute
Return value:  return 0 to prevent the mob's death cry

This type of trigger fires when the mob dies (but not when if it is purged).

Note: Death triggers attached to charmed mobs will not fire unless the trigger
   also has the Charmed type.

Variables:
  &c%actor%&0 - The character killing this mob, if any.

See also: MTRIG CHARMED
#d
"FIGHT TRIGGER" "MTRIG FIGHT" TRIGEDIT-MOB-FIGHT

Charmed trigger type to allow this.

See also: MTRIG CHARMED
#d
"HITPRCNT TRIGGER" "HITPERCENT TRIGGER" "MTRIG HITPRCNT" "MTRIG HITPERCENT" TRIGEDIT-MOB-HITPERCENT TRIGEDIT-MOB-HITPRCNT 

HitPrcnt (mob trigger)

Argument type:  percentage of health points remaining

Activated during combat when the mobile's hit point percentage drops below a 
specified percentage.

Note: HitPrcnt triggers attached to charmed mobs will not fire unless the
   trigger also has the Charmed type.

Variables:
  &c%actor%&0 - The character this mobile is fighting.

See also: MTRIG CHARMED
#d
"MEMORY TRIGGER" "MTRIG MEMORY" TRIGEDIT-MOB-MEMORY

Memory (mob trigger)

Argument type:  percent chance to execute

Activated when the mobile encounters a character in its memory (&yMREMEMBER&0) 
list, and there is no over-riding command. Any mobile making use of mremember 
MUST have a memory script, even if it will never be called.

Note: Memory triggers attached to charmed mobs will not fire unless the trigger
   also has the Charmed type.

Variables:
  &c%actor%&0 - The character being remembered.

#d
MAGGRO %AGGRO%

Usage:  %aggro% [victim]

This will cause the mob to attempt to attack the victim, similar to the AGGR
flag. If the victim cannot be attacked, the mob will then attempt to hit allies
of that victim, or someone else (including an NPC) present in the room.

If the mob is already fighting, %aggro% will still cause it to hit the victim
and change focus to that victim (similar to mkill). If the victim isn't a valid
target, the mob will still try to hit someone else but WON'T change focus to
them.

Calling %aggro% with no argument will simply attempt to attack someone in the
room with the mob, similar to the AGGR flag.

No error is sent if the mob cannot find a valid target in the room.

Example:
  %aggro% %actor%
#d
MFOLLOW %FOLLOW% TRIG-FOLLOW

Usage:  mfollow <victim>

The mobile will begin following the victim without the revealing "starts
following you" message. A silent follow.

Note: You must use "mfollow" (not "%follow%") for this.
#d
MFORGET MREMEMBER %FORGET% %REMEMBER%

Usage:  mremember <victim> [command]
        mforget <victim>

Mremember places the victim into the mob's memory list, and will run Memory
triggers each time the mob meets the victim. You can also provide a command
which will be run next time the mob sees the player.

Mforget removes a character from the memory list, which also happens
automatically after a Memory trigger or mremember'd command occurs.

Note: Any mob using the mremeber command MUST have a Memory trigger attached. 
   It doesn't matter if the Memory trigger is never called (0% chance).
Note: You must use "mremember" and "mforget" (not like "%remember%") for this.

See also: MTRIG MEMORY
#d
MGOTO %GOTO%

Usage:  mgoto <target>

This command moves the mob to the given target. The target may be an object,
room, vehicle, or character. No message is given on either end.

You can use i### to target a room in the mob's current adventure instance by
its room template vnum instead of live room number (if used in an instanced
zone).

Note: You must use "mgoto" (not "%goto%") for this.

Examples:
  mgoto 1233
  mgoto Rumble
  mgoto fountain
#d
MHUNT %HUNT% HUNT 

Usage:  mhunt <victim>

The mobile will begin to hunt for victim, and engage in combat upon finding 
them. Only Mobiles may use this command. Hunting mobs will walk through !MOB
rooms.

Note: You must use "mhunt" (not "%hunt%") for this.
#d
MJUNK %JUNK%

Usage:  mjunk <object | all>
   
The object in the mob's inventory specified is removed from the game. 
'Mjunk all' removes all of the objects in the mob's inventory. No message 
is sent by this command.

Note: You must use "mjunk" (not "%junk%") for this.

See also: %PURGE%
#d
MKILL %KILL%

Usage:  mkill <victim>

Mkill causes the mob to hit the victim. It is the same as kill, except mkill 
works in cases where kill might not. It can also be used to change targets in
a group fight.

Note: You must use "mkill" (not "%kill%") for this.

Example:
  mkill %actor%
#d
MMOVE %MOVE%

Usage:  mmove

This causes the mob to attempt a normal random movement, like it does
periodically anyway. This won't work on SENTINEL mobs, or ones who are
entangled or following someone.

Note: You must use "mmove" (not "%move%") for this.

Example:
  mmove
#d
