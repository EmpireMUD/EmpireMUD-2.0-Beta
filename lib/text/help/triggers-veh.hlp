"DESTROY TRIGGER" "VTRIG DESTROY" TRIGEDIT-VEH-DESTROY

Argument type:  percent chance to execute
Return value:  return 0 to prevent the vehicle's destruction

The Destroy trigger is called when a vehicle would be destroyed by siege
damage, burning, or lack of maintenance. You can prevent this destruction by
returning 0 from the script (which will restore 1 health point and put out any
fire).

Use the "return 0" option cautiously, as this may make the vehicle
indestructible.
