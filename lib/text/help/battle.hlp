#
ARMOR "LIGHT ARMOR" "MEDIUM ARMOR" "HEAVY ARMOR" "MAGE ARMOR"

Light Armor (Battle ability)
Mage Armor (Battle ability)
Medium Armor (Battle ability)
Heavy Armor (Battle ability)

In order to wear pieces of armor, you must learn the appropriate ability.

Mage armor is usually meant for casters and healers, and tends to give bonuses
to magical traits.

Light armor offers little protection, but makes the wearer more lithe and
deadly in combat. It is meant for melee DPS characters.

Medium armor is a hybrid of light and heavy armor, and is good for those who
do a lot of solo exploration and adventuring, as well as for PVP players.

Heavy armor is the mainstay of tanks, and offers great protection at the cost
of making it harder for the wearer to deal damage.

Each ability gains experience when you take damage while wearing the associated
armor type. Wearing more pieces increases the rate.

"BIG GAME HUNTER" BGH

Big Game Hunter (Battle ability)

DISARM DISARMED

Disarm (Battle ability)

Usage:  disarm [target]
Cooldown:  30 seconds
Duration:  15 / 25 seconds
Cost:  15 move
Debuff type:  Battle

In battle you can attempt to disarm your target, reducing the damage he deals by
knocking away his weapon for a few seconds. If you're fighting someone already,
you do not have to type the target name -- it will target him automatically.

If you are disarmed, you don't have to re-equip your weapon yourself. When the
disarm affect wears off, it will still be in your <wield> slot.

Disarmed players lose their weapon damage, and will make basic unarmed 'hit'
attacks (unless the disarmed weapon was a caster weapon, in which case they
receive a basic 'mana blast' attack instead).

Disarmed mobs lose half their damage and their attack type is changed to 'hit'
or 'mana blast', but not all mobs can be disarmed.

Gain experience when you try to disarm someone, even if it fails.

#
ENDURANCE

Endurance (Battle ability)

Endurance teaches you how to properly take a blow from your opponent. This is
a core step in becoming a tank -- the person who holds the enemy's focus in
battle, and takes all of the damage while his or her friends attack back.

Endurance doubles up to 1000 health points and gives you +25% of any health
over that 1000. For example, a person who naturally has 2000 health would have
3250 with Endurance.

Gain experience when you take damage.
