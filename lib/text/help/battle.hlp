BATTLE "BATTLE SKILL"

Battle (skill)

The skill that governs combat is Battle. It trains warriors to take heavier
hits -- or deal them out. Take on vampires and mages using only wits and
weapons. Hit a target at 60 yards with a bow. And more.

Endurance branch: Become a tank and lead your allies into battle.
Sparring branch: Learn to hit faster and harder, and finish the fight.
Big Game Hunter branch: Take on the world's monsters with no fear.
Archery branch: Strike from afar.

ARMOR "LIGHT ARMOR" "MEDIUM ARMOR" "HEAVY ARMOR" "MAGE ARMOR"

Light Armor (Battle ability)
Mage Armor (Battle ability)
Medium Armor (Battle ability)
Heavy Armor (Battle ability)

In order to wear pieces of armor, you must learn the appropriate ability.

Mage armor is usually meant for casters and healers, and tends to give bonuses
to magical traits.

Light armor offers little protection, but makes the wearer more lithe and
deadly in combat. It is meant for melee DPS characters.

Medium armor is a hybrid of light and heavy armor, and is good for those who
do a lot of solo exploration and adventuring, as well as for PVP players.

Heavy armor is the mainstay of tanks, and offers great protection at the cost
of making it harder for the wearer to deal damage.

Big Game Hunter (Battle ability)

The Big Game Hunter branch of the Battle skill is for people who aren't

dangerous game: vampires, werewolves, and mages.

supernaturals. It also opens up special abilities to help you take them down.

#
DISARM DISARMED

Disarm (Battle ability)

Usage:  disarm [target]
Cooldown:  30 seconds
Cost:  15 move
Debuff type:  Battle

In battle you can disarm your target, reducing the damage he deals by knocking
away his weapon for a few seconds. If you're fighting someone already, you do
not have to type the target name -- it will target him automatically.

If you are disarmed, you don't have to re-equip your weapon yourself. When
the disarm affect wears off, it will still be in your <wield> slot.

Disarmed players lose their weapon damage, and will make basic unarmed 'hit'
attacks (unless the disarmed weapon was a caster weapon, in which case they
receive a basic 'mana blast' attack instead).

Disarmed mobs lose half their damage and their attack type is changed to 'hit'
or 'mana blast'.
#
"DUAL-WIELD" "DUAL WIELD"

Dual-Wield
Class ability: Assassin, Bandit, Smuggler

will never attack with it.

Your off-hand receives a significant to-hit penalty.
#
ENDURANCE

Endurance (Battle ability)

Endurance teaches you how to properly a blow from your opponent. This is the
a core step in becoming a tank -- the person who holds the enemy's focus in
battle, and takes all of the damage while his or her friends attack back.

Endurance doubles up to 1000 health points and gives you +25% of any health
over that 1000. For example, a person who naturally has 2000 health would have
3250 with Endurance.
