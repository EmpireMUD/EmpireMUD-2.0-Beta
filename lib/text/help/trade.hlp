TRADE "TRADE SKILL"

Trade (skill)

The Trade skill contains abilities for collecting, crafting, and trading goods
of all kinds.

You can get started in Trade by chipping rocks together to make handaxes,
tanning leather, crafting certain items, or weaving cloth.

Many craftable items are scalable, meaning their stats depend on the level of
the person who crafts them. HELP SCALABLE CRAFTS has a full explanation.

but a superior hammer will allow you to forge more quickly.

and Jewelry. You can also learn to be a Master Blacksmith.

With the basic Forge skill, you can create:
  nails (x4)  1 iron ingot
  imperium spike (x3)  1 imperium ingot

HONE HONED

Hone (Trade ability)

Usage:  hone <item>

Characters with the Trade skill can learn to hone their own items, making them

used on the user's own gear.

Just like Enchant, the power gained from Hone is based on either your crafting
level or your composite level (whichever is higher). It's also limited by the
level of the item you hone (more powerful items get bigger bonuses). Players
with Trade skill below 100 will also be limited by their Trade skill.

You can hone the following item slots:
 Weapon: harden weapon (Bonus-Physical), brighten weapon (Bonus-Magical)
 Off-Hand: polish relic (Bonus-Healing)
 Shield: reinforce shield (Resist-Physical/Magical)

REFORGE REFASHION

Refashion (Trade ability)
Reforge (Trade ability)

Usage:  reforge <item | person> name <new name>
        reforge <item | person> <renew | superior>

A great blacksmith (weapons) or tailor (armors and shields) can use this
ability in three ways:

Name: You can take a generic item and give it a name. The name must contain
the original name (except a leading a/an/the). Requires 1 blue iris per 3 gear
rating on the item.

Renew: This undoes any enchantments, disenchantments, name, superior quality, 
and all other effects, and restores the item to its base stats. Requires 1
bloodstone per 3 gear rating on the base (unmodified) item.

Superior: If the item is a crafted item that could have superior qualities,
this adds those qualities and marks it (superior). You can only use this on
the normal version of an item that can be made superior, and only if you have
the correct Master ability. Requires 1 green seashell per 3 gear rating on the
item.

An item must be in your inventory to reforge it. However, if another player
"shares" an item, you can reforge that item by targeting that player by name
(e.g. "reforge Lyra superior").

#
"SCALABLE CRAFTS" "SCALABLE CRAFTING" "CRAFTING SCALABLES"

Many craftable items (including things made with brew, craft, forge, and sew)
are scalable, which means they change in power and attributes based on the
level and skills of the person.

For normal craftables, the level range of the ability will determine the upper
level limit of the item created. For example, the arming sword made by
Iron Blades can only be levels 55 to 75, since that's the level range of
Iron Blades. Abilities bought at levels 0-49 will make items up to level 50.
Abilities bought at levels 50-74 will make crafted items that scale as high as
75. Abilities bought at 75-100 make crafted items scaled up to 100. The actual
level will be based on the Trade skill of the crafter, within that range. The
item will never scale higher than the maker's crafting level.

If a craft recipe comes from an adventure zone, loot drop, or other non-ability
source, it can make an item that scales up to the player's crafting level --
even if it requires a certain ability to craft it. Only normal craftable items
are constrained by the ability's level range. However, the content builder who
added those adventure craft recipes may have set limits on what level the
craftables may scale to.

If a craftable item is made superior, it will scale higher even at the same
level.

The identify command will help you determine if two crafted items are different
in power, even if they have the same name.

SHIP SHIPS 

(Disambiguation: Did you mean HELP SHIP COMMAND ?)

The most efficient form of ocean travel, ships can be sailed at a fixed speed
(with 'sail <direction>'), consuming no moves. Multiple players can combine
their efforts to sail a single ship faster.

Ships can be used to manually transport resources, though you should be wary of
leaving them unattended, as autostorage while at sea (though slower) will cause
the ship's cargo to be permanently lost. Each room of a ship can hold up to 404
items, but large items count twice each as if they were kept in your inventory.

Ships can also be used to transport resources automatically using the ship
command.
