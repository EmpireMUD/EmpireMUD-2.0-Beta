TRADE "TRADE SKILL"

Trade (skill)

The Trade skill contains abilities for collecting, crafting, and trading goods
of all kinds.

You can get started in Trade by crafting things using the Primitive Crafts and
Cook abilities, by chipping rocks together to make handaxes, or by tanning skins
into leather.

Many craftable items are scalable, meaning their stats depend on the level of
the person who crafts them. HELP SCALABLE CRAFTS has a full explanation.

Hone (Trade ability)

Usage:  hone <item> <type>

gear you have honed.

Just like Enchant, the power gained from Hone is based on either your crafting
level or your composite level (whichever is higher). It's also limited by the
level of the item you hone (more powerful items get bigger bonuses). Players
with Trade skill below 100 will also be limited by their Trade skill.

You can hone the following item slots:

Reforge (Trade ability)

Usage:  reforge <item | person> name <new name>
        reforge <item | person> <renew | superior>

A great blacksmith (weapons) or tailor (armors and shields) can use this
ability in three ways:

Name: You can take a generic item and give it a name. The name must contain
the original name (except a leading a/an/the). Requires 1 blue iris per 3 gear
rating on the item.

Renew: This undoes any enchantments, disenchantments, name, superior quality, 
and all other effects, and restores the item to its base stats. Requires 1
bloodstone per 3 gear rating on the base (unmodified) item.

Superior: If the item is a crafted item that could have superior qualities,
this adds those qualities and marks it (superior). You can only use this on
the normal version of an item that can be made superior, and only if you have
the correct Master ability. Requires 1 green seashell per 3 gear rating on the
item.

An item must be in your inventory to reforge it. However, if another player
"shares" an item, you can reforge that item by targeting that player by name
(e.g. "reforge Lyra superior").

#
"SCALABLE CRAFTS" "SCALABLE CRAFTING" "CRAFTING SCALABLES" "ITEM SCALING" OBJECT SCALING"

Many craftable items (including things made with brew, craft, forge, and sew)
are scalable, which means they change in power and attributes based on the
level and skills of the person who crafted them.

For most recipes, the level of the resulting item will be the lowest of:
  The level range of the ability that gives the recipe (50/75/100).
  Your level in the ability's skill (usually Trade).
  Your Crafting level.
  Your skill level (if under 100).

For example, the arming sword from Iron Blades cannot be higher than level 75,
since this ability is from the 50-75 level range.

Recipes which come from crafting patterns follow slightly different rules - see
HELP CRAFTING PATTERNS for more information.
