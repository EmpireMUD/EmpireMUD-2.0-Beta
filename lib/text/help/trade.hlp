TRADE "TRADE SKILL" TRD

(Disambiguation: did you mean HELP TRADE COMMAND or TRADE RELATIONS)

Trade (skill)

The Trade skill contains abilities for collecting, crafting, and trading goods
of all kinds.

You can get started in Trade by crafting things using the Primitive Crafts and
Cook abilities, by chipping flints with rocks to make handaxes, or by tanning
skins into leather.

Many craftable items are scalable, meaning their stats depend on the level of
the person who crafts them. HELP SCALABLE CRAFTS has a full explanation.

You get additional Trade abilities when you reach level 100, depending on
which other skills you have at high levels. Use the 'role' command to choose
which set of skills to use.

gear you have honed.

Just like Enchant, the power gained from Hone is based on either your crafting
level or your composite level (whichever is higher). It's also limited by the
level of the item you hone (more powerful items get bigger bonuses). Players
with Trade skill below 100 will also be limited by their Trade skill.

on the item). Requires 1 blue iris per 3 gear rating on the item.

Renew: This undoes any enchantments, disenchantments, name, superior quality, 
and all other effects, and restores the item to its base stats. Requires 1
bloodstone per 3 gear rating on the base (unmodified) item.

Superior: If the item is a crafted item that could have superior qualities,
this adds those qualities and marks it (superior). You can only use this on

"SCALABLE CRAFTS" "SCALABLE CRAFTING" "CRAFTING SCALABLES" "ITEM SCALING" "OBJECT SCALING"

Many craftable items (including things made with brew, craft, forge, and sew)
are scalable, which means they change in power and attributes based on the
level and skills of the person who crafted them.

For most recipes, the level of the resulting item will be the lowest of:
  Your Crafting level (which is your combined skill level, plus any bonuses).
  The level range of the ability that gives the recipe (50/75/100).

For example, the arming sword from Iron Blades cannot be higher than level 75,
since this ability is from the 50-75 level range.

Recipes which come from crafting patterns follow slightly different rules - see
HELP CRAFTING PATTERNS for more information. Most importantly, they aren't
limited by the level range of the ability.

SEW SEWING

Sew (Trade ability)
Command:  sew [number] <item>
          sew info <item>

The art of sewing is one of the oldest and simplest trade skills, but it also
makes some of the finest clothing and the lightest armor. The primary resources
required for sewing are skins or cloth. The Master Tailor ability will allow
you to sew faster, as will sewing in a tailor shop.

For a list of clothing items you can sew, see HELP CLOTHING.

With basic Sewing, you can make:
  whip -- primitive weapon
  canteen -- holds drinks
  satchel -- increases carrying capacity
  tent -- a portable shelter
  sail -- for shipbuilding

Additional sewing items are available from other abilities in the Trade skill,
as well as patterns and crafts hidden around the world.

SHIP SHIPS 

(Disambiguation: Did you mean HELP SHIP COMMAND ?)

The most efficient form of ocean travel, ships can be sailed at a fixed speed
(with 'sail <direction>'), consuming no moves.

Ships can be used to manually transport resources, but items inside a ship's
storage hold (via 'put <item> [in] <ship>') will auto-store to the empire's
main island if the ship is left alone at sea.

Ships can also be used to transport resources automatically using the ship
command.
