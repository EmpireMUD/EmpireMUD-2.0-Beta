SURVIVAL "SURVIVAL SKILL" SUR

Survival (skill)

Survival is the art of keeping yourself alive in the wilderness. With practice,
you can learn to travel farther, faster, and over more treacherous terrain than
most men dare.

To get started on Survival, try digging up some rocks or gathering some sticks.

You get additional Survival abilities when you reach level 100, depending on
which other skills you have at high levels. Use the 'role' command to choose
which set of skills to use.

MOUNT DISMOUNT RIDING RIDE "ALL-TERRAIN RIDING" "ALL TERRAIN RIDING" ATR SADDLE

Ride (Survival ability)
All-Terrain Riding (Survival ability)

Usage:  dismount
        mount [animal]
        mount <list | swap> <keyword(s)>
        mount release

Once you have learned to Ride, travel becomes faster and easier. With All-
Terrain Riding, you can coax your mount across rivers and mountains, too.
Riding lowers the delay during movement, as well as the movement point cost.

When you dismount, the animal you were riding is stored. You can see it on your
affects list. If you type "mount" again without targetting a new animal, you
will re-mount your stored ride. You can store more than one mount and swap them
at a stable. If you target a new animal while you already have a stored mount,
the new one will be added to your stored mounts.

If you have a saddle in your inventory, you will automatically equip it when
you mount up. The saddle will be removed automatically when you dismount. You
can make a simple saddle with Basic Crafts.

Flying mounts require All-Terrain Riding, or Fly + Ride.

Ride gains experience just from moving around while mounted, but All-Terrain
Riding only gains experience when you cross water or mountains while mounted.

Note: The "ride" command can also be used to get onto carts and other ridable
vehicles; this does not require any ability.
