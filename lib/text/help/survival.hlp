MOUNT DISMOUNT RIDING RIDE "ALL-TERRAIN RIDING" "ALL TERRAIN RIDING" ATR SADDLE

Ride (Survival ability)
All-Terrain Riding (Survival ability)

Usage:  dismount
        mount [animal]

Once you have learned to Ride, travel becomes faster and easier. With All-
Terrain Riding, you can coax your mount across rivers and mountains, too.
Riding lowers the delay during movement, as well as the movement point cost.

When you dismount, the animal you were riding is stored. You can see it on your
affects list. If you type "mount" again without targetting a new animal, you
will re-mount your stored ride. If you target a new animal while you already
have a stored mount, the old one will be released.

If you have a saddle in your inventory, you will automatically equip it when
you mount up. The saddle will be removed automatically when you dismount. You
can make a simple saddle with Basic Crafts.

Flying mounts require All-Terrain Riding, or Fly + Ride, or Dragonriding.

Note: The "ride" command can also be used to get onto carts and other ridable
vehicles; this does not require any ability.
