EMPIRE EMPIRES

Empire is a skill, a command, and a grouping of people and land.

&cEmpire (grouping)&0: Found an empire by claiming your first piece of land. Other
   players can join you to help you grow your empire, or you could join some-
   one else's empire.
   
&cEmpires (Command)&0: List prominent empires by default, active empires with
   -m, and all empires with -a. If you specify an empire name or number, it
   will give you details on that empire. You can also use -p <name> to look up
   an empire by player name. Immortals can use -v to look up an empire by vnum.
   Empires are ranked by ESCORE.
   
&cEmpire (skill)&0: Chopping, mining, building, and other empire chores will
   help you get started in this skill. It contains abilities for building more
   buildings and expanding your empire.
   
   You can gain your initial Empire skill by doing empire chores including:
   chopping trees, scraping trees, planting crops, harvesting crops, mining,
   and building.

You can learn about founding and managing empires on HELP EMPIRE GUIDE.

#
BARDE BARDING "ARMORED HORSE"

Barde (Empire ability)
Location:  stable
Cost:  10x (common metal)

Barding allows you to put armor on your noble steeds. This makes them less
vulnerable to attack, and more impressive to look upon. Most mounts can be
barded. You can only barde mounts in a stable. You cannot remove barding from
mounts.

Barded mounts will not de-spawn like normal animals.

Gain experience when you barde something.

#
BUILD BUILDING "BASIC BUILDINGS"

Usage:  build <building> [direction]
        build <monument> <god>
        build info <building>

This command is used to create buildings using raw materials. If you build a
shrine or temple, you must specify a god to dedicate it to. Most other
buildings require a direction that they'll face. Resources are added from left
to right in the requirements list (you can't add nails before lumber).

You can just get information on a building, like what it costs to build, by
typing "build info <building>".

You can't build on land that's inside another empire's city radius while at war
with that empire.

Until a building is completed, you can walk into and out of it freely, and you
can't build any additional rooms inside. Once finished, nobody who is not
loyal to your empire will be able to enter.

All buildings give experience as you add materials to their construction.

Basic buildings:
  &g.&0()&g.&0 hut
  &y.&0()&y.&0 mudhut
  (--) cabin
  (==) house
  &y.&0[]&y.&0 pueblo
  &y[==]&0 cliffdwelling

  {LL} lumberyard -- store lumber
  {SS} smokehouse -- store meats
  {TT} tannery -- store skins
  {UU} utilityshed -- store tools
  |__| quarry -- must be on flat land facing a mountain
  &y|__|&0 claypit -- must be on flat land facing water
  ..x. familygrave -- used as a respawn point (city only)

#
CEDE

Usage:  cede <person>

This is used to cede one acre of land to anyone else currently in the game. You
can only cede the map tile you're standing on, and it must be owned by your
empire. Ceding land to a god or immortal so that you can claim more land may
get you in trouble.

Your target must have the 'bother' toggle turned on. You can't cede land to an
empire that is at war.

#
CHORES CHORE

Chores (Empire ability)

Doing simple chores will help you raise your Empire skill at low levels.

Chores include:
  chop                      press *
  harvest                   quarry
  mill *                    saw

(Disambiguation: Did you mean HELP CITY INFORMATION or HELP CITY COMMANDS ?)
#
"CITY COMMANDS"

- &ccity list&0: This lists the cities already established in the empire, as well
    as how many city points are available to spend. Immortals can specify an
    empire to list all of its cities.

- &ccity found <name>&0: This founds a new city on the spot where you're standing.
    It creates a "city center" building, which is open (does not block move-
    ment). It costs 1 city point. You must be 25 tiles away from a starting
    location and 30 from another empire's city (10 tiles if allied).

- &ccity upgrade <name>&0: This upgrades the given city by 1 level at the cost of
    1 city point.

- &ccity downgrade <name>&0: This downgrades the given city by 1 level, or
    removes its city status entirely if it was at the minimum.

- &ccity claim <name> [all]&0: This claims all unclaimed structures within
    the borders of the city, up to your maximum territory -- or, all tiles with
    the 'all' option.

- &ccity abandon <name>&0: This abolishes the city, refunds your city points, and
    un-claims all territory within the city border.

- &ccity rename <number> <new name>&0: This allows you to rename a city.

- &ccity traits <name> [add | remove] <trait(s)>&0: Change city traits.

#
"CITY INFORMATION" CITIES

Usage:  city <command> [city name]

Empires are made up of cities. An empire gets 1 city point per 2 members and
can use a city point to found a new city, or to upgrade an existing one. As
you upgrade a city, its radius grows. 80% of an empire's territory must be
inside its cities. If you lose members in your empire, you won't lose any of
your existing cities, but you won't get back city points for abandoning those
extra cities if you no longer have enough members for them.

The boundaries of the city only show how far its influence reaches. You must
still claim the territory within the borders if you want it to be part of your
empire. Other empires can also claim land inside your city boundary, if you
don't claim it yourself.

There is a 60-minute waiting period between when you found a city, and when it
counts as a city for things like City Teleportation, certain buildings such as
the Great Hall, for guard towers, and for some other game rules.

You can get additional city points from accruing at least 4000 wealth, for
achieving Prominence, and for having at least 10 technologies.

EmpireMUD periodically checks if cities are completely empty and, if so,
will remove the city center and refund the city point. This helps keep the map
clean, and you can prevent it by making sure there is at least one building in
your city.

Types of cities:
 -C1-  Outpost (5)
 -C2-  Village (10)
 -C3-  City (15)
 -C4-  Capital (25)

#
"CITY LIGHTS"

City Lights (Empire ability)

When you purchase City Lights, your empire's citizens will keep all claimed
territory well lit.

There is no advantage to more than 1 member of an empire purchasing this
ability.

Gain experience passively if you're online at night.
#
CLAIM

Usage:  claim [target]

Claims the acre you're currently on for your empire. This can also be used
to claim vehicles.

You can't claim land that's inside another empire's city radius while at war
with that empire.

See also: PRIVILEGE, ABANDON, CEDE, PUBLICIZE, TERRITORY
#
COMMERCE

Commerce (Empire ability)

The Commerce ability allows your empire to trade globally, increasing its
influence. The empire can now gain additional territory from its Wealth, up to
3x its normal limit (for a total of 4x). Only one member of the empire must have
this ability to gain the benefit. There is no additional benefit to more members
having it.

Commerce also allows you to build the mint building, and mint your own coins:

[MM] mint

Gain experience by building mints, and passively over time.

See also: BUILD, MINT, TERRITORY, WEALTH
#
"CUSTOMIZE BUILDING"

Customize Building (Empire ability)

Usage:  customize building name <name | none>
        customize building description <set | none>

Customize Building lets you change the names and descriptions of your build-
ings. You must own the building you're trying to customize, and have permission
from your empire.

When editing a custom description, you can use /fi to add linebreaks and indent
the first line. Generally descriptions look best in the 3-9 line range. You can
use /h to get more information on editor commands, and /s to save and exit.

Gain experience by customizing buildings.

See also: STRING EDITOR
#
DEDICATE

Usage:  dedicate <person>

Some monuments can be dedicated to a particularly powerful person or god. Once
dedicated, they can never be re-dedicated, so choose carefully.

To find buildings that can be dedicated, try 'helpsearch dedicate'.
#
"DEEP MINES"

Deep Mines (Empire ability)

Mines you dig or prospect will have roughly 50% more ore. You must be the first
player to build a mine or prospect on a given mountain tile (at least, since
the last mountain reset), otherwise your deep mines ability will have no effect.
Mines will only display as 'deep' if, thanks to this bonus, they have more ore
than the normal maximum.

Once you have started a mine on (or prospected) a given mountain tile, it will
remain a deep mine unless the mountain is reset at the end of the year. For
more information on mountain resets, see HELP MINE.

Gain experience when a tile benefits from your ability.

See also: MINE, PROSPECT, RARE METALS
#
DEFECT

Usage:  defect

This command allows you to exit an empire with which you are disillusioned. 
For whatever reason you leave, make sure you get outside of the radius of all 
the guard towers. They'll shoot a traitor on sight!

Once you defect, you must wait at least two hours before you can join any
empire. This can help protect empires from duplicitous players.

To transfer all members from one empire to a new one (for example, to change
leaders or merge two empires), do not use defect. If the leader of the old
empire pledges to the new one, all members and empire inventory will transfer.

See also: PLEDGE
#

#
"EMPIRE SCORE" ESCORE

Empire scores are used to rank empires on the full empire list. The score is
made up of several components, which are shown in the score breakdown on the
empire detail page ("empire <name>").

Each score is based on how far an empire is above or below the average rating
in that category. For example, if the average empire has 2 members, any empire
with that many members gets 5 points in the "Members" score.

You can see average numbers by typing "mudstats empires".

See also: MUDSTATS
#
ENROLL

Usage:  enroll <person>

When a person has pledged his loyalty to your empire, you can enroll him into
it. This will start him at the lowest empire level.

If you enroll the leader of another empire, that empire's entire roster,
inventory, and territory will also become part of your empire. However, if
the newly-merged empire doesn't have enough city points available, some of
the merged cities may lose their city status.

See also: CITY, EXPEL, PROMOTE, PRIVILEGE, PLEDGE
#
ESAY ETALK EHISTORY EMPIREHISTORY

Usage:  etalk <text>
        etalk #<rank> <text>
        ehistory

Allows you to talk to your empire on a private channel, even from the other
side of the world. This is very useful for espionage and other secret
activities you might be participating in.

The ehistory command shows you the last 20 messages you received on the empire
channel.

You can start your message with a # followed by an empire rank to send the
message to only members of that rank or higher. If multiple ranks have similar
names, the lowest will be used. Spaces must be replaced with underscores, and
you can abbreviate - for example, #high_l will send to "High Lords".

You can start chats with * (asterisk) to make them channel-emotes.

Examples:
 > etalk Hi guys!
 > etalk #high_lord Hi, High Lords!
 > etalk #lord *bows before the other lords.
#
EXCAVATE EXCAVATION TRENCH MOAT FILLIN

Usage:  excavate
        fillin

Using a shovel, your own strength, and a lot of time, you can excavate a
trench from a desert or plains. Once the trench is complete, it will begin
to fill with water. Eventually, it becomes a river.

The "fillin" command is the opposite of excavate: it fills trenches in until
they are ordinary plains or desert again. It will also work on a player-created
oasis or river. It takes 1 minute to begin a fillin on a completed trench; if
you cancel the action or are interrupted, you must start the minute over.

You can only excavate and fill in on claimed land.

When a desert trench fills with water, it will become an Oasis instead of a
river. Oases convert into rivers if they are adjacent to other rivers or to
oceans.

There are three ways to fill a finished trench with water:
 - If there is more water adjacent, the trench will fill quickly.
 - If you pour water out on the ground, you can fill the trench yourself.
 - If you wait long enough, it will fill with rain water on its own.

An unfinished trench will not fill with water.

See also: CLAIM, OASIS DRAINAGE
#
EXCHANGE

Usage:  exchange <item>
        exchange <number> [empire] coins

You can exchange valuable metals or foreign coins at any mint or vault. You
will always receive coins in the local currency. Exchange rates may vary based
on the reputation and alliances of the empire who minted the coins you're
trading in.

The exchange rates can be found on HELP COINS.

See also: COINS, KEEP, MINT, VAULT
#
EXPEL

Usage:  expel <person>

Kicks a person out of the empire.

See also: PRIVILEGE, DEMOTE, ENROLL
#
EXPORT IMPORT

Usage:  <import | export> list [empire]
        <import | export> remove <item name>
        <import | export> analyze <item name>
        import add <at most cost> <under limit> <item name>
        export add <at least cost> <over limit> <item name>

If your empire has Trade Routes, you can set up import and export rules to
automatically exchange goods for coins with any empire you have trade relations
with. Coins will be converted from your currency to theirs (for importing), or
from their currency to yours (for exporting). The better your relationship with
that empire, the more even the exchange of money will be.

The analyze command will show you which of your trading partners has the item
available.

An empire can only import 100 items per day total, and imports/exports run at
noon each in-game day.

If you want to replace an entry with a new cost tolerance, you can "add" it
again without removing it. It will replace the old entry.

HINT: If you're having trouble picking the right item for import/export because
another item is matching the name, try having the correct item in your own
inventory. This command will try to match an item in your inventory before
searching the item database.

#
FAME

Empires gain Fame by building great monuments. This trait is currently only
used for the Fame component of empire score, and for the "Most Famous Empire"
leaderboard (shown when you quit).

#
FINDMAINTENANCE "FIND MAINTENANCE"

Usage:  findmaintenance [coordinates | island]

This command finds all the buildings in your empire that are damaged or need
at least 2 years of maintenance. If you give it target coordinates or an island
name, it will instead list the resources needed to repair that location or all
buildings you own on the island.

If you are using Workforce to maintain your buildings, this generally means
that only buildings not serviced by your workforce will show up on the list.
Only buildings that have taken at least 20% of their maximum damage or require
any maintenance show up on the list.

Immortals can give an empire name as the first argument to see maintenance
for that empire.

highest-ranking leaders).

You can unset your home from anywhere, or clear the owner for the building
you're in. Only the empire leaders can clear homes they don't own.

Cost:  30 move points per person or 60 for 'all'
Duration:  30 minutes (in same empire) or 5 minutes (if not)

A powerful leader can inspire his friends and allies with a rousing speech.

#
ISLANDS

Usage:  islands

This command lists the islands your empire has territory or einventory on
(including warehouse storage). You must have the Navigation ability. The
coordinates for each island are the approximate center of the island.

Empires can rename islands using the 'customize island' command. These names
become global if the empire is the only one with cities on the island, or
all empires on the island share the same custom name for it.

Note: Immortals with the 'empires' grant can list the islands of any empire.

#
LOCKSMITHING

Locksmithing (Empire ability)

MEMBERS MEMBERSHIP "EMPIRE MEMBERS" "EMPIRE MEMBERSHIP" "EMPIRE GREATNESS" "TIMED-OUT" "TIMED OUT" TIMEOUTS "EMPIRE TIMEOUT"

You can add other players to your empire by having them type "pledge empire
name", then you "enroll player". They don't have to be online at the same time
as you to do this, so you can add other characters on your account to the
empire this way.

When more than one character on an account is in the same empire, they all
count as just 1 member. Only the highest Greatness among those alts is
contributed to the empire, but all alts contribute playtime. This prevents
players from having an unfair advantage from having many alts in the same
empire.

The roster command shows a list of all players in the empire. Members high-
lighted in red have timed out, and are no longer contributing abilities, tech-
nologies, or Greatness to the empire. The timeout period is based on each
character's play time, and may be as short as a week or as long as 4 months.

As members become timed out the empire may no longer qualify for as many
cities or as much territory as before. If it has more than double its allowed
cities, they will begin to auto-abandon. Outside-of-city territory will also
start to automatically reduce itself. If the empire times out completely, it
may lose all its territory. Finally, if no members log on for a very long time,
the empire itself may crumble to dust.

Note: Players with extremely low average playtime may never count as active
empire members.

members must be at least the privilege's rank (or higher). For example, if
"chop" is set to rank 2, only people rank 2 or higher can chop.

Most privileges only apply to claimed land. All members can chop on unclaimed
land, regardless of privilege.

#
QUARRY

Command:  quarry
Building:  |__|  Quarry  (Basic Buildings)

A quarry must be built on plains or desert, facing a mountain. Quarries are a
good place to dig up rocks. You can also quarry stone here using the "quarry"
command. You will find more rocks before a quarry depletes, compared to digging
anywhere else.

If you have the "dig" workforce enabled, your citizens will only dig if you
have a quarry.

Quarries count as in-city territory as far away as 3x a city's normal radius.

"RARE METALS"

Rare Metals (Empire ability)

You learn to find the most valuable mining locations in each part of the
mountain. Mines you build or prospect have a chance to find rare metals. If you
were not the first person to mine or prospect a mountain tile (since the last
mountain reset), your rare metals ability does not apply.

Once you have started a mine (or prospected) a given mountain tile, it will
keep its current metal type unless the mountain is reset at the end of the
year. For more information on mountain resets, see HELP MINE.

Gain experience whenever you are the first to find a rare metal tile.

See also: MINE, DEEP MINES, PROSPECT
#
RECLAIM

have Reward, they may both choose to reward the same member.

Each Reward gives a member of your empire +5 bonus experience for the day.
Just like regular bonus experience, it will expire at the end of the day if
it isn't used.

You cannot reward yourself or your alts.

This ability gains experience when you reward someone.

#
ROSTER

#
TERRITORY

(Disambiguation: Did you mean HELP TERRITORY COMMAND ?)

Each empire is limited in how much territory it can claim. The formula for
territory is:

(Greatness x 35) + (Wealth / 10) + (Technologies x 15)

* Greatness: This is the total Greatness of all members.
* Wealth: Only empires with the Commerce tech can gain territory from Wealth.
      You can gain wealth by storing precious metals in your vault. Max
      territory from commerce is equal to 3x normal territory.
* Technologies: Each technology you unlock (e.g. City Lights) gives 15. These
      only count once per empire, so two members with City Lights will not
      result in +30 territory.

80% of an empire's maximum must be within the borders of its cities. Only 20%
of your total territory can be outside of cities. Roads and some buildings, such
as Mines, count as in-city territory up to 3x as far out as the edge of the city
radius.

When an empire's members start to time out from lack of gameplay, the empire
may start losing territory.

See also: CITIES, COMMERCE, EMPIRE TIMEOUT, TERRITORY COMMAND
#
"TERRITORY COMMAND"

Usage:  territory [type]
        territory <empire> [type]  -- immortals only

The territory command will list all your territory that is outside of your
cities. This command groups tiles that are near each other so that it shows you
fewer lines. It does not list territory inside of your cities, but you can find
a list of your cities on the "city list" command.

You can optionally specify a building or terrain type and see all your tiles of
that type.

You require the Navigation ability to use the "territory" command, because it
gives coordinates.

See also: CITIES, NAVIGATION, TERRITORY
#
TREE TREES LOGS

Stored at: Lumber Yard

Get a tree using the chop command.
Get a log using the scrape command.

Trees are found by chopping down forests. They are used in most buildings,
but you must scrape them first. Forests will regrow if you don't chop down all
four trees on a tile, and they also spread from overgrown forests to adjacent
plains. Desert groves are different, and will spring up anywhere in the desert.

You can stop the spread of trees by chopping them all down, by building a
fence, or by laying a road. Chant of Nature can be used to grow trees on bare
plains.

See also: CHANT OF NATURE, CHOP, BUILD, SCRAPE
#
TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGIES "EMPIRE TECHNOLOGY"

Empires can earn many different technologies to boost their abilities and
effectiveness. Technologies also earn the empire a small boost in territory.

Available technologies are:
 - Glassblowing*: allows you to craft various items which require glass
 - Lights: all claimed territory lights up at night
 - Locks: enemy infiltration is much more difficult
 - Apiaries*: lets you cook with honey and craft with wax
 - Seaport*: you have a dock!
 - Workforce: citizens will do chores for the empire
 - Prominence: the empire appears on the main list, and has an extra city
 - Commerce: wealth grants extra territory
 - Portals: members of the empire can open portals
 - Master Portals: the empire's portals have unlimited range
 - Skilled Labor: the workforce can perform even more chores
 - Trade Routes: lets you set up trade with other empires
 - Exarch Crafts: your workforce can craft nexus crystals

* some technologies only function on the same island as the building that
  provides them

#
"TRADE ROUTES"

Trade Routes (Empire ability)

Buildings:
 [$$] tradingpost

Commands:  import, export, trade

Trade Routes allows the empire to automate trade with other empires. You must
have trade relations with empires in order to import or export goods with them.
Use the import and export commands to configure your trade rules. You can only
import and export resources from normal storage.

You can also build trading posts, which grant you access to the global trade
of unique items.

Trade Routes counts as a technology.

Gain experience by building trading posts, not by trading.

See also: DIPLOMACY, EXPORT, IMPORT, TECHNOLOGY, WAREHOUSE, TRADING POST
#
TRAITS "EMPIRE TRAITS" "CITY TRAITS" "FRONTIER TRAITS"

Usage:  eedit frontiertraits [add | remove] <trait(s)>
        city traits <name> [add | remove] <trait(s)>

You can set your empire's traits with the eedit command. For your cities and
the area around those cities (up to 100 tiles from the city center), you set
traits using the city command. For frontier traits -- the traits far from your
cities -- you use eedit.

 Distrustful - Your guard towers and city guard attack anyone you don't
   explicitly ally or form a non-aggression pact with. (Peace and trade agree-
   ments also count.)

See also: EEDIT, CITY
#
TUNNEL

&y/&0OO&y\&0  Tunnel  (Empire ability)

Command:  tunnel <direction>

This command allows you to begin construction on a tunnel through a mountain
range. Tunnels always go in a straight line, and you can't pass through each
part of a tunnel until it is finished. If you destroy one side of the tunnel,
the other side will result in a dead end.

To begin the tunnel, stand on flat ground (plains, desert, etc) next to the
mountain and type "tunnel east" (or whichever way the mountain is). You must
have permission to build on both ends of the tunnel (you can't tunnel into
someone else's claimed land).

The entrance and exit to the tunnel will be on the mountain tiles at the ends.

Tunnels may be interlinked.

Gain experience by using resources to build tunnels, not by beginning their
construction.

See also: DISMANTLE, INTERLINK
#
UNPUBLICIZE

Usage:  unpublicize

CAUTION: This is not a toggle!

Unpublicize removes the public status of ALL buildings owned by your empire
instantly.

See also: PUBLICIZE
#
WEALTH

An empire's Wealth is determined by the amount of precious metal and coins in
its vaults (or secret cache).

With the Commerce ability, this wealth adds to the empire's territory at a
rate of 1 territory per 10 wealth. This additional territory is subject to
diminishing returns.

See also: COMMERCE, EXCHANGE, MINT, VAULT, SECRET CACHE
#
WITHDRAW

Usage:  withdraw <number> coins

Privileged empire members may withdraw coins from the empire's vaults. You can
only withdraw coins minted by that empire; no empire hoards other types of
coins.

See also: COMMERCE, DEPOSIT, EXCHANGE, MINT
#
WORKFORCE "SKILLED LABOR"

Workforce, Skilled Labor (Empire abilities)

Usage:  workforce [chore] [on | off | <limit>] [island name | all]
        workforce no-work
        workforce where [here]
        workforce copy <island name>

Once at least one member of an empire has the Workforce ability, the empire's
citizens (NPCs) will start performing simple tasks for the empire. You can
enable or disable each specific task using the "workforce" command. The work-
force is generally much slower than a player would be at the same task.

Typing "workforce" without a "type" after it will show you which workforce
chores are currently enabled. Empire leaders can set the minimum rank to change
the workforce settings, and even the member with the Workforce ability may not
be able to change those settings.

The workforce is made up of the empire's citizens (NPCs). These citizens will
only work within 20 map tiles of their own homes, and must be on the same 
island. Citizens will only work on claimed land. Only one citizen will work
a given location at a time.

If you set your own limit on a chore, the empire won't produce more than that
limit on each island. Not all chores use the numeric limit (for example, the
abandon-* toggles don't use the limit).

You can use the "workforce copy" command to copy the workforce limit
configuration of another island into the island you are currently in.

Note: Your workforce will only do chores if your empire has less than 200 of
the resource provided by the chore. For example, miners won't do any work in
iron mines if you have 200 iron ore. This does not apply to dismantling. If
you have Skilled Labor, the cap is 750 instead. This cap is per-island. There
is also a total cap for any given resource, which is based on the number of
players in your empire. After passing the total cap, the locals will collect
much less of that resource on each island.

See &cHELP WORKFORCE CHORES&0 for a list of all workforce chores with descriptions.

The Workforce ability gains experience when most workforce chores are done
(including skilled ones) while you are online.
The Skilled Labor ability gains experience when skilled chores are done while
you are online.

#
"WORKFORCE CHORES" "WORKFORCE TYPES"

Workforce types:
  &ybuilding:&0 NPCs will build any building that has been started, or dismantle
            any building you've started to dismantle. They build using stored
            empire resources, not items on the ground. Workers can't provide
            coins, liquids (like water), or pools (like mana) for building. Any
            building that requires one of these must be finished manually.
  &ychopping:&0 NPCs will chop down forests and desert groves (Not orchards -
