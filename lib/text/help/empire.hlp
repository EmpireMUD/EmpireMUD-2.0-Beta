EMPIRE EMPIRES EMP

Empire is both a command and a grouping of people and land.

&cEmpire (grouping)&0: Found an empire by claiming your first piece of land. Other
   players can join you to help you grow your empire, or you could join some-
   one else's empire.
   
&cEmpires (Command)&0: List prominent empires by default, active empires with
   -m, and all empires with -a. If you specify an empire name or number, it
   will give you details on that empire. You can also use -p <name> to look up
   an empire by player name. Immortals can use -v to look up an empire by vnum.
   Empires are ranked by ESCORE.

You can learn about founding and managing empires on HELP EMPIRE GUIDE.

#
ABANDON

Usage:  abandon [target/coordinates]

This command allows you to abandon a building or acre of land which your 
empire no longer wants. This falls under the cede privilege.

It can also be used to abandon vehicles.

See also: CEDE, CLAIM, PRIVILEGE, PUBLICIZE
#
BANNER

The empire banner can be changed with the eedit command.

It's a good idea to choose a distinct color so that people can see your empire
on the political map.

#
BARDE BARDING "ARMORED HORSE"

Usage:  barde <mount>
Location:  stable
Cost:  10x (common metal)

Barding allows you to put armor on your noble steeds. This makes them less
vulnerable to attack, and more impressive to look upon. Many mounts can be
barded. You can only barde mounts in a stable. You cannot remove barding from
mounts.

Barded mounts will not de-spawn like normal animals.

#
BUILD BUILDING "BASIC BUILDINGS"

Build (Trade ability)

Usage:  build <building> [direction]
        build <monument> <god>
        build info <building>

Speed boosts:  Faster Chores bonus, haste

This command is used to create buildings using raw materials. If you build a
shrine or temple, you must specify a god to dedicate it to. Most other
buildings require a direction that they'll face. Resources are added from left
to right in the requirements list (you can't add nails before lumber).

You can just get information on a building, like what it costs to build, by
typing "build info <building>".

You can't build on land that's inside another empire's city radius while at war
with that empire.

Until a building is completed, you can walk into and out of it freely, and you
can't build any additional rooms inside. Once finished, nobody who is not
loyal to your empire will be able to enter.

All buildings give experience as you add materials to their construction.

Basic buildings:
  &g.&0()&g.&0 hut
  &y.&0()&y.&0 mudhut
  (--) cabin
  (==) house
  &y.&0[]&y.&0 pueblo
  &y[==]&0 cliffdwelling
  (&c~~&0) well
  &y/&0[]&y\&0 mine
  (FF) forge
  (MM) mill
  (PP) potter
  (SS) stable
  .&g^&?.&co&0 park
  .{}. shrine

  {CC} cannery -- store fruits
  {FF} foundry -- store metals
  {GG} granary -- store grains
  {PP} gravelpit -- store rocks
  {LL} lumberyard -- store lumber
  {SS} smokehouse -- store meats
  {TT} tannery -- store skins
  {UU} utilityshed -- store tools
  |__| quarry -- must be on flat land facing a mountain
  &y|__|&0 claypit -- must be on flat land facing water
  ..x. familygravesite -- used as a respawn point (city only)

#
CEDE

Usage:  cede <person>

This is used to cede one acre of land to anyone else currently in the game. You
can only cede the map tile you're standing on, and it must be owned by your
empire. Ceding land to a god or immortal so that you can claim more land may
get you in trouble.

Your target must have the 'bother' toggle turned on. You can't cede land to an
empire that is at war.

#
CITY

(Disambiguation: Did you mean HELP CITY INFORMATION or HELP CITY COMMANDS ?)
#
"CITY COMMANDS"

Usage:  city <command> [city name]

- &ccity list [empire]&0: This lists the cities already established in the
    empire, as well as how many city points are available to spend. You can
    also use this command to find other empires' cities (but it can't find
    their outposts).

- &ccity found <name>&0: This founds a new city on the spot where you're standing.
    It creates a "city center" building, which is open (does not block move-
    ment). It costs 1 city point. You must be 25 tiles away from a starting
    location and 30 from another empire's city (10 tiles if allied).

- &ccity upgrade <name>&0: This upgrades the given city by 1 level at the cost of
    1 city point.

- &ccity downgrade <name>&0: This downgrades the given city by 1 level, or
    removes its city status entirely if it was at the minimum.

- &ccity claim <name> [all]&0: This claims all unclaimed structures within
    the borders of the city, up to your maximum territory -- or, all tiles with
    the 'all' option.

- &ccity abandon <name>&0: This abolishes the city, refunds your city points, and
    un-claims all territory within the city border.

- &ccity rename <number> <new name>&0: This allows you to rename a city.

- &ccity traits <name> [add | remove] <trait(s)>&0: Change city traits.

#
"CITY INFORMATION" CITIES

Empires are made up of cities. An empire gets 1 city point per 2 members and
can use a city point to found a new city, or to upgrade an existing one. As
you upgrade a city, its radius grows. 60% of an empire's territory must be
inside its cities.

The boundaries of the city only show how far its influence reaches. You must
still claim the territory within the borders if you want it to be part of your
empire. Other empires can also claim land inside your city boundary, if you
don't claim it yourself.

There is a 60-minute waiting period between when you found a city, and when it
counts as a city for things like City Teleportation, certain buildings such as
the Great Hall, for guard towers, and for some other game rules.

City points come from:
 - 1 point per 2 members (rounded up)
 - 1 point for having at least 4000 wealth
 - 1 point for having at least 10 technologies
 - 1 point from progression rewards

EmpireMUD periodically checks if cities are completely empty and, if so,
will remove the city center and refund the city point. This helps keep the map
clean, and you can prevent it by making sure there is at least one building in
your city. You will also start to lose cities after 1 week if your empire
shrinks and you no longer have enough city points available.

#
"CITY TYPES" OUTPOST VILLAGE CAPITAL

Usage:  city <upgrade | downgrade> <city name/number>

There are four sizes of city available, but your empire must unlock larger
city sizes through the progression system before you can upgrade to them. The
only difference between them is the radius of the in-city territory.

 -C1-  Outpost (radius 5, outskirts 20)
 -C2-  Village (radius 10, outskirts 40)
 -C3-  City (radius 15, outskirts 60)
 -C4-  Capital (radius 25, outskirts 100)

Some buildings, such as mines, count as in-city territory even in the outskirts
(4x the normal distance from the city center).

You can see the city radius by typing 'toggle political' and looking at the
background highlight (on the visual map), or you can use the 'mark' command
to measure distances from the center if you're using a screenreader.

See also: MARK, CITY INFORMATION, CITY COMMANDS, PROGRESSION
#
CLAIM

Usage:  claim [target]

Claims the acre you're currently on for your empire. This can also be used
to claim vehicles.

You can't claim land that's inside another empire's city radius while at war
with that empire.

See also: PRIVILEGE, ABANDON, CEDE, PUBLICIZE, TERRITORY
#
DEDICATE

Usage:  dedicate <person>

Some monuments can be dedicated to a particularly powerful person or god. Once
dedicated, they can never be re-dedicated, so choose carefully.

To find buildings that can be dedicated, try 'helpsearch dedicate'.
#
"DEEP MINES"

Deep Mines (Empire technology)

Mines your empire digs or prospects will have 50% more ore. You must be the
first empire to build a mine or prospect on a given mountain tile (at least,
since the last mountain reset), otherwise your deep mines technology will have
no effect.

Mines will only display as 'deep' if, thanks to this bonus, they have more ore
than the normal maximum.

Once you have started a mine on (or prospected) a given mountain tile, it will
remain a deep mine unless the mountain is reset at the end of the year. For
more information on mountain resets, see HELP MINE.

See also: MINE, PROSPECT, RARE METALS
#
DEFECT

Usage:  defect CONFIRM

This command allows you to exit an empire with which you are disillusioned. 
For whatever reason you leave, make sure you get outside of the radius of all 
the guard towers. They'll shoot a traitor on sight!

Once you defect, you must wait at least two hours before you can join any
empire. This can help protect empires from duplicitous players.

To transfer all members from one empire to a new one (for example, to change
leaders or merge two empires), do not use defect. If the leader of the old
empire pledges to the new one, all members and empire inventory will transfer.

You must type 'CONFIRM' (in all caps) after the command to do this.

See also: PLEDGE
#
DEMOTE

Usage:  demote <person> [rank]

Demotes a person within the empire. You can specify the name of the rank
you'd like to demote them to, or just do it one rank at a time.

See also: PRIVILEGE, PROMOTE, EXPEL
#
DEPOSIT

Usage:  deposit <number> [empire] <coins>

You can deposit coins in your empire's vault. Foreign coins are always
exchanged for local currency at the current exchange rate, and stored as local
currency.

#
DIPLOMACY PEACE WAR ALLIANCE TRUCE DISTRUST

Usage:  diplomacy <option> <empire>
        diplomacy cancel <option> <empire>

* To declare war, an empire must immediately spend an amount of money based
on the difference between the two empires' composite scores. You can see the
cost to declare war on the empire detail page for any empire you're not in
a non-aggression pact (or better) with.

See also: EMPIRE SCORE
#
DISMANTLE-MINES "DISMANTLE MINES"

The dismantle-mines workforce chore will cause mines to be dismantled auto-
matically when they are empty. You can prevent this on individual mines using
the nodismantle command.

See also: NODISMANTLE, WORKFORCE
#
EEDIT "EMPIRE EDITOR" "EDIT EMPIRE"

EFIND

Usage:  efind <name>
        efind all

The efind command allows you to find items that have been left around your
empire. Efind shows you the coordinates and the name of the room, but you may
not find it very useful without the Navigation ability.

Efind will also find vehicles belonging to your empire, even if they aren't
in your own territory.

You can use "efind all" to find all items on the ground in your empire. The
"all" option will skip items that you can't pick up (boards, carts).

Example:
 > efind cart

#
ELOG ELOGS "EMPIRE LOGS"

Usage:  elog [type] [lines]

The elog command allows you to view recent logs for your empire. You can
specify a log type to see only logs of that type, otherwise you'll see them
all. You can also specify a number of lines to see. It always shows the LAST
lines up to that many total. The "logs" privilege is required to do this.

Immortals can also target any empire using: elog [empire] [type] [lines]

Log types are:
 Admin - Logs related to empire editing.
 Diplomacy - Logs related to diplomacy.
 Hostility - Logs related to war and stealth.
 Logins - This log is always empty because logins aren't saved.
 Members - Logs related to promotions, defections, and other member changes.

 Territory - Logs such as cede, and city commands.
 Trade - Logs related to empire trades.
 Workforce - Shows logs of food consumption (shown only on request).

This shows you your empire's MOTD (Message Of The Day). It is set in eedit.

See also: EEDIT
#
EMPIREIDENTIFY EIDENTIFY EID

Usage:  empireidentify <item>
        eidentify <item>
       
The eidentify command identifies an item stored by your empire, showing you
the same information that identify would as well as a listing of quantities
of this item across the empire's islands.

* Immortals may use this command on any inventory. Mortals may only use it on
their own empire. If the empire name has more than one word, you can use
quotation marks.

See also: EFIND, WORKFORCE, EINVENTORY, IDENTIFY
#
EMPIREINVENTORY EINVENTORY EINV

Usage:  empireinventory [item | all]
        einventory [item | all]
       
The einventory command shows the contents of all storage buildings and rooms
for the island you're currently on. It won't work out in the ocean. You can
use the ship command to move resources between multiple islands.

You can specify an item name to see only matching items. If you specify a name,
it'll show them whether or not the item is stored on your current island. If
you don't specify a name, you can see all items regardless of where they are
stored using "einv all".

You can use "warehouse inventory" to see items in warehouse (unique) storage.

* Immortals may use this command on any inventory. Mortals may only use it on
their own empire. If the empire name has more than one word, you can use
quotation marks.

See also: EFIND, SHIPPING, WORKFORCE, EIDENTIFY
#
"EMPIRE SCORE" ESCORE

Empire scores are used to rank empires on the full empire list. The score is
made up of several components, which are shown in the score breakdown on the
empire detail page ("empire <name>").

Each score is based on how far an empire is above or below the average rating
in that category. For example, if the average empire has 2 members, any empire
with that many members gets 5 points in the "Members" score.

You can see average numbers by typing "mudstats empires". All score averages
are medians. Inventory is how many thousands of items you have; all other
average numbers are simple counts.

See also: MUDSTATS
#
ENROLL

Usage:  enroll <person>

When a person has pledged his loyalty to your empire, you can enroll him into
it. This will start him at the lowest empire level.

If you enroll the leader of another empire, that empire's entire roster,
inventory, and territory will also become part of your empire. However, if
the newly-merged empire doesn't have enough city points available, some of
the merged cities may lose their city status.

See also: CITY, EXPEL, PROMOTE, PRIVILEGE, PLEDGE
#
ESAY ETALK EHISTORY EMPIREHISTORY

Usage:  etalk <text>
        etalk #<rank> <text>
        ehistory

Allows you to talk to your empire on a private channel, even from the other
side of the world. This is very useful for espionage and other secret
activities you might be participating in.

The ehistory command shows you the last 20 messages you received on the empire
channel.

You can start your message with a # followed by an empire rank to send the
message to only members of that rank or higher. If multiple ranks have similar
names, the lowest will be used. Spaces must be replaced with underscores, and
you can abbreviate - for example, #high_l will send to "High Lords".

You can start chats with * (asterisk) to make them channel-emotes.

Examples:
 > etalk Hi guys!
 > etalk #high_lord Hi, High Lords!
 > etalk #lord *bows before the other lords.
#
EXCAVATE EXCAVATION TRENCH MOAT CANAL FILLIN

Usage:  excavate
        fillin

Speed boosts:  Faster Chores bonus, haste

Using a shovel, your own strength, and a lot of time, you can excavate a
trench from a desert or plains. Once the trench is complete, it will begin
to fill with water. Eventually, it becomes a canal.

The "fillin" command is the opposite of excavate: it fills trenches in until
they are ordinary plains or desert again. It will also work on a player-created
oasis or canal. It takes 1 minute to begin a fillin on a completed trench; if
you cancel the action or are interrupted, you must start the minute over.

You can only excavate and fill in on claimed land. If you abandon your claim to
a canal or trench, it will slowly fill in over time.

When a desert trench fills with water, it will become an oasis instead of a
canal. Oases convert into canals if they are adjacent to other canals or water
sources.

There are three ways to fill a finished trench with water:
 - If there is more water adjacent, the trench will fill quickly.
 - If you pour water out on the ground, you can fill the trench yourself.
 - If you wait long enough, it will fill with rain water on its own.

An unfinished trench will not fill with water.

See also: CANAL, CLAIM, OASIS DRAINAGE
#
EXCHANGE

Usage:  exchange <item>
        exchange <number> [empire] coins

You can exchange valuable metals or foreign coins at any mint or vault. You
will always receive coins in the local currency. Exchange rates may vary based
on the reputation and alliances of the empire who minted the coins you're
trading in.

The exchange rates can be found on HELP COINS.

See also: COINS, KEEP, MINT, VAULT
#
EXPEL

Usage:  expel <person>

Kicks a person out of the empire.

See also: PRIVILEGE, DEMOTE, ENROLL
#
EXPORT IMPORT

Usage:  <import | export> list [empire]
        <import | export> remove <item name>
        <import | export> analyze <item name>
        import add <at most cost> <under limit> <item name>
        export add <at least cost> <over limit> <item name>
Requires:  Trade Routes goal

If your empire has Trade Routes, you can set up import and export rules to
automatically exchange goods for coins with any empire you have trade relations
with. Coins will be converted from your currency to theirs (for importing), or
from their currency to yours (for exporting). The better your relationship with
that empire, the more even the exchange of money will be.

The analyze command will show you which of your trading partners has the item
available.

An empire can only import 100 items per day total, and imports/exports run at
noon each in-game day.

If you want to replace an entry with a new cost tolerance, you can "add" it
again without removing it. It will replace the old entry.

HINT: If you're having trouble picking the right item for import/export because
another item is matching the name, try having the correct item in your own
inventory. This command will try to match an item in your inventory before
searching the item database.

See also: COINS
#
FAME

Empires gain Fame by building great monuments. This trait is required to
complete some progression goals, and for the "Most Famous Empire" leaderboard
(shown when you quit).

See also: EMPIRE SCORE, PROGRESS
#
FINDMAINTENANCE "FIND MAINTENANCE"

Usage:  findmaintenance [coordinates | island]

This command finds all the buildings in your empire that are damaged or need
at least 2 years of maintenance. If you give it target coordinates or an island
name, it will instead list the resources needed to repair that location or all
buildings you own on the island.

If you are using Workforce to maintain your buildings, this generally means
that only buildings not serviced by your workforce will show up on the list.
Only buildings that have taken at least 20% of their maximum damage or require
any maintenance show up on the list.

Immortals can give an empire name as the first argument to see maintenance
for that empire.

See also: MAINTAIN, WORKFORCE
#
FRONTIER OUTSKIRTS

An empire's 'frontier' is the area that's far from cities. Specifically, it's
any area that's more than 4x a city's radius away from the city center.

The area between a city's border and the frontier is called the 'outskirts'.
For example, an outpost with radius 5 has outskirts out to 20 tiles, and the
rest is frontier.

See also: FRONTIER TRAITS
#
HAVENS "BUILD HAVENS"

Build Haven (Vampire ability)

The Build Haven ability unlocks additional buildings.

&g.&0[]&g.&0 househaven
&g^&0[]&g^&0 burrowhaven  (chameleon)
&Y.&0[]&Y.&0 pueblohaven
&y/&0()&y\&0 cavehaven  (chameleon)

See also: BUILD, VAMPIRE
#
HOME "HESTIAN TRINKET"

Usage:  home
        home set
        home unset
        home clear
        use trinket

You can choose a house in your empire to make your own private residence. Once
you set it as your home, other members of the empire can't enter (except the
highest-ranking leaders).

You can unset your home from anywhere, or clear the owner for the building
you're in. Only the empire leaders can clear homes they don't own.

Once you choose your home, you can teleport back to it using the Hestian
Trinket. See your local potter to make this sacred emblem of the home.

Only buildings that normally house citizens can be set as homes. This does not
include buildings where adding a bedroom grants a citizen, if the building
itself doesn't house citizens.

See also: FINE POTTERY
#
ISLANDS

Usage:  islands

This command lists the islands your empire has territory or einventory on
(including warehouse storage). You must have the Navigation ability. The
coordinates for each island are the approximate center of the island.

Empires can rename islands using the 'customize island' command. These names
become global if the empire is the only one with cities on the island, or
all empires on the island share the same custom name for it.

Note: Immortals with the 'empires' grant can list the islands of any empire.

See also: CHART, CUSTOMIZE ISLAND, SURVEY
#
MAINTAIN MAINTENANCE DISREPAIR

Usage:  maintain

Buildings fall into disrepair over time. Different buildings require different
items for maintenance, which are shown beneath the building's description or
map.

It takes roughly two and a half months (realtime) for buildings to decay,
although some buildings (and all unfinished buildings) decay faster.

Use findmaintenance to find buildings in need. You can also use workforce to
maintain your buildings.

See also: FINDMAINTENANCE, RUINS, WORKFORCE
#
MEMBERS MEMBERSHIP "EMPIRE MEMBERS" "EMPIRE MEMBERSHIP" "EMPIRE GREATNESS" "TIMED-OUT" "TIMED OUT" TIMEOUTS "EMPIRE TIMEOUT"

You can add other players to your empire by having them type "pledge empire
name", then you "enroll player". They don't have to be online at the same time
as you to do this, so you can add other characters on your account to the
empire this way.

When more than one character on an account is in the same empire, they all
count as just 1 member. Only the highest Greatness among those alts is
contributed to the empire, but all alts contribute playtime. This prevents
players from having an unfair advantage from having many alts in the same
empire.

The roster command shows a list of all players in the empire. Members high-
lighted in red have timed out, and are no longer contributing abilities, tech-
nologies, or Greatness to the empire. The timeout period is based on each
character's play time, and may be as short as a week or as long as 4 months.

As members become timed out the empire may no longer qualify for as many
cities or as much territory as before. If it has more than double its allowed
cities, they will begin to auto-abandon. Outside-of-city territory will also
start to automatically reduce itself. If the empire times out completely, it
may lose all its territory. Finally, if no members log on for a very long time,
the empire itself may crumble to dust.

Note: Players with extremely low average playtime may never count as active
empire members.

See also: ENROLL, PLEDGE, ROSTER, TERRITORY
#
OFFENSES

Usage:  offenses [-e empire] [-p player] [-n number to show]

This command shows recent offenses against your empire. Offenses expire after
one week (or sooner if they were done during war or were avenged).

You can use the %c or %C prompt codes to receive a notification when you have
unviewed offenses.

Immortals can view offenses from other empires by giving an empire name (in
quotes if necessary) as the first argument.
#
PAN

Usage:  pan [direction]
Speed boosts:  Finder ability

Using a simple metal pan, you can pan for gold flakes next to the river. It's
rare to find anything, but it's something to do. You can pan an adjacent map
tile, or the one you're standing in.

See also: DEPLETION, FORGE
#
PLEDGE JOIN

Usage:  pledge <empire | cancel>

Allows you to pledge your loyalty to an empire. If they find you worthy, you
may be allowed to join. You can cancel your pledge if you change your mind,
but you must wait an hour to pledge again.

If the leader of one empire pledges to another empire and is enrolled, the
entire original empire becomes a part of the second empire, including all
players and empire inventory. However, if there aren't enough city points in
the second empire after the merger, some cities from the original empire will
lose their city status.

See also: CITY, DEFECT, ENROLL
#
PROMOTE

Usage:  promote <person> [rank]

This can be used to advance someone to a specific rank, or to advance them
one rank at a time. They must be in your empire to do this.

See also: DEMOTE, ENROLL, PRIVILEGE
#
PRIVILEGE PRIVILEGES

Privileges can be set in the eedit command.

These privileges can help keep new members from messing up your empire, but
be sure to give people something fun to do. In order to do any of these things,
members must be at least the privilege's rank (or higher). For example, if
"chop" is set to rank 2, only people rank 2 or higher can chop.

Most privileges only apply to claimed land. All members can chop on unclaimed
land, regardless of privilege.

Members of allied empires can only use privileges available at rank 1 to your
empire's members while on your territory, no matter what rank they have in
their own empires.

Privileges:
  claim: can claim new lands for the empire
  build: can build on claimed land
  harvest: can harvest claimed land
  promote: can promote other members
  chop: can chop trees on claimed land
  cede: can abandon/cede empire lands
  enroll: can add new members
  withdraw: can take gold and items from the vault
  diplomacy: can set up diplomatic relations with other empires
  customize: can customize claimed buildings
  workforce: can turn workforce chores on and off
  stealth: can engage in hostile stealth actions against other empires
  cities: can found and abandon cities
  trade: can set up import and export rules
  logs: can view elogs
  shipping: can use the ship command to move goods
  homes: can set a home
  storage: can retrieve from storage buildings
  warehouse: can retrieve unique items from the warehouse
  progress: can buy progression goals

#
PROSPECT

Usage:  prospect

A good prospector can determine what minerals are in the ground without
exploratory mining. If your empire has Deep Mines or Rare Metals and are the
first person to prospect a mountain tile (since the last mountain reset), that
tile will benefit from your Deep Mines and/or Rare Metals until the next
mountain reset. For more info on mountain resets, see HELP MINE.

Prospecting happens instantly if your empire was the last one to prospect the
tile.

#
PUBLICIZE

Usage:  publicize

Allows you to make an area public so others can use it. This also undoes the 
same command. Others cannot withdraw from public vaults or dismantle public 
buildings.

If a room is made public, other players may take items from the ground without
being marked "hostile".

#
QUARRY

Quarry (Primitive Crafts ability)

Command:  quarry
Building:  |__|  Quarry  (Build ability)
Speed boosts:  Faster Chores bonus, haste

A quarry must be built on plains or desert, facing a mountain. Quarries are a
good place to dig up rocks. You can also quarry stone here using the "quarry"
command. You will find more rocks before a quarry depletes, compared to digging
anywhere else.

If you have the "dig" workforce enabled, your citizens will only dig if you
have a quarry.

Quarries count as in-city territory when built in the outskirts (4x radius).

See also: DEPLETION, DIG
#
"RARE METALS"

Rare Metals (Empire technology)

Your empire has learned to find the most valuable mining locations in each part
of the mountain. Mines you build or prospect have a chance to find rare metals.
If you were not the first person to mine or prospect a mountain tile (since the
last mountain reset), your rare metals ability does not apply.

Once you have started a mine (or prospected) a given mountain tile, it will
keep its current metal type unless the mountain is reset at the end of the
year. For more information on mountain resets, see HELP MINE.

See also: MINE, DEEP MINES, PROSPECT
#
RECLAIM

Usage:  reclaim

This command can be used to take ownership of a tile during war. You must be
standing on the tile, and must already own 4 or more adjacent tiles. Reclaiming
will take a little while, and can be interrupted by combat.
#
ROSTER

Usage:  roster [all]

This command shows you the members of your empire and lets you know who's on-
line and who's been gone a while. The color of the player's main skills (if not
white) indicates their role, if any: &aCaster&0, &jHealer&0, &yTank&0 or &rMelee&0.

If you don't use the "all" option, you won't see members who have timed out.

High-level immortals can also target other empires with this command.

See also: CLASS, WHO
#
SILVER GOLD COPPER

Copper, silver, and gold are found in mines, although more rarely than iron
ore. They are used as currency in many empires for trade and exchange. Some
empires, however, prefer to use material goods instead.

#
TERRITORY

(Disambiguation: Did you mean HELP TERRITORY COMMAND ?)

Each empire is limited in how much territory it can claim. The amount of
territory is based on empire progression, members, and other factors. You can
see this broken down on the empire details.

* Greatness: This is the total Greatness of all members.
* Wealth: After unlocking the correct progression rewards, wealth contributes
      to territory. You can gain wealth by storing precious metals in your
      vault. The amount of territory from wealth is not linear. Max territory
      from wealth is equal to 3x normal territory.

Most territory must be location within an empire's cities. 35% of your total
territory can be on the outskirts of cities (up to 4x city radius), and another
5% of the territory can be either outskirts or on the frontier (beyond the
outskirts). The 'estats' command shows how much territory of each type you can
currently claim (note: claiming more than 60% of your total in-city will cause
your outskirts to show a lower cap because that's all the land that is
available).

Roads and some buildings, such as Mines, count as in-city territory even in the
outskirts.

When an empire's members start to time out from lack of gameplay, the empire
may start losing territory.

#
"TERRITORY COMMAND"

Usage:  territory [type]
        territory [outskirts | frontier]
        territory <empire> [type]  -- immortals only

The territory command will list all your territory that is outside of your
cities. This command groups tiles that are near each other so that it shows you
fewer lines. It does not list territory inside of your cities, but you can find
a list of your cities on the "city list" command.

You can optionally specify a building or terrain type and see all your tiles of
that type. You can also specify 'outskirts' or 'frontier' to filter out-of-city
territory to just one of those two categories. You can also type 'territory
building' to get a list of all your buildings.

You require the Navigation ability to use the "territory" command, because it
gives coordinates.

See also: CITIES, NAVIGATION, TERRITORY
#
TREE TREES LOGS

Stored at: Lumber Yard

Get a tree using the chop command. Get a log using the scrape command.

Trees are found by chopping down forests. They are used in most buildings,
but you must scrape them first. Forests will regrow if you don't chop down all
four trees on a tile, and they also spread from overgrown forests to adjacent
plains. Desert groves are different, and will spring up anywhere in the desert.

Different terrains will yield different types of trees, which in turn have
their own type of logs and lumber. Not all trees can be scraped or sawed. Try
looking at the tree; its description might tell you what to do with it.

You can stop the spread of trees by chopping them all down, by building a
fence, or by laying a road. Chant of Nature can be used to grow trees on bare
plains.

Basic tree types are:
 - a large tree (temperate forests)
 - some rough wood (desert groves)
 - a massive jungle tree (tropical jungles)
 - an enchanted tree (magical forests)

#
TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGIES "EMPIRE TECHNOLOGY"

Empires can earn many different technologies to boost their abilities and
effectiveness.

Available technologies are:
 - Glassblowing*: allows you to craft various items which require glass
 - City Lights: all claimed territory lights up at night
 - Locks: enemy infiltration is much more difficult
 - Apiaries*: lets you cook with honey and craft with wax
 - Seaport*: you have a dock!
 - Workforce: citizens will do chores for the empire
 - Prominence: the empire appears on the main list
 - Citizens: people will move into homes and bedrooms in your empire
 - Portals: members of the empire can open portals
 - Master Portals: the empire's portals have unlimited range
 - Skilled Labor: the workforce can perform even more chores
 - Trade Routes: lets you set up trade with other empires
 - Exarch Crafts: your workforce can craft nexus crystals
 - Deep Mines: Mines will be 50% deeper than normal.
 - Rare Metals: Mines can have rare metals.
 - Bonus Experience: Empire members get +5 bonus experience each day.
 - Tunnels: The empire can use the 'tunnel' command.

* some technologies only function on the same island as the building that
  provides them

TRAITS "EMPIRE TRAITS" "CITY TRAITS" "FRONTIER TRAITS"

Usage:  eedit frontiertraits [add | remove] <trait(s)>
        city traits <name> [add | remove] <trait(s)>

You can set your empire's traits with the eedit command. For your cities and
the outskirts around those cities (up to 4x the city's radius), you set traits
using the city command. For frontier traits -- the traits far from your cities
-- you use eedit.

 Distrustful - Your guard towers and city guard attack anyone you don't
   explicitly ally or form a non-aggression pact with. (Peace and trade agree-
   ments also count.)

See also: EEDIT, CITY, FRONTIER, OUTSKIRTS
#
UNPUBLICIZE

Usage:  unpublicize

CAUTION: This is not a toggle!

Unpublicize removes the public status of ALL buildings owned by your empire
instantly.

See also: PUBLICIZE
#
WEALTH

An empire's Wealth is determined by the amount of precious metal and coins in
its vaults (or secret cache).

With the correct progression rewards, this wealth adds to the empire's
territory (based on progression), up to 3x its normal limit (for a total of
4x).

See also: EXCHANGE, MINT, VAULT, SECRET CACHE
#
WITHDRAW

Usage:  withdraw <number> coins

Privileged empire members may withdraw coins from the empire's vaults. You can
only withdraw coins minted by that empire; no empire hoards other types of
coins.

See also: DEPOSIT, EXCHANGE, MINT
#
WORKFORCE "SKILLED LABOR"

Workforce (goal)
Skilled Labor (goal)

Usage:  workforce [chore] [on | off | <limit>] [island name | all]
        workforce no-work
        workforce where [here]
        workforce why [chore | location | here]
        workforce copy <island name>
        workforce keep <item name>

Once at least one member of an empire has the Workforce reward, the empire's
citizens (NPCs) will start performing simple tasks for the empire. You can
enable or disable each specific task using the "workforce" command. The work-
force is generally much slower than a player would be at the same task. Most
workforce chores consume food from your empire's inventory. Food is collected
at 8pm each day.

Typing "workforce" without a "type" after it will show you which workforce
chores are currently enabled. Empire leaders can set the minimum rank to change
the workforce settings.

The workforce is made up of the empire's citizens (NPCs). These citizens will
only work within 20 map tiles of their own homes, and must be on the same 
island. Citizens will only work on claimed land. Only one citizen will work
a given location at a time.

If you set your own limit on a chore, the empire won't produce more than that
limit on each island. Not all chores use the numeric limit (for example, the
abandon-* toggles don't use the limit).

You can use the "workforce copy" command to copy the workforce limit
configuration of another island into the island you are currently in. Using
"workforce keep" will prevent your workforce from using any of an item.

Note: Your workforce will only do chores if your empire has less than a certain
amount of the resource provided by the chore. This amount is 100 per member,
plus any additional workforce cap provided by progression goals. This does not
apply to dismantling. Workers on each island will still collect a small amount
of each resource if your empire is over the cap globally.

See &cHELP WORKFORCE CHORES&0 for a list of all workforce chores with descriptions.

#
"WORKFORCE CHORES" "WORKFORCE TYPES"

Workforce types:
  &ybuilding:&0 NPCs will build any building that has been started, or dismantle
            any building you've started to dismantle. They build using stored
            empire resources, not items on the ground. Workers can't provide
            coins, liquids (like water), or pools (like mana) for building. Any
            building that requires one of these must be finished manually.
  &ychopping:&0 NPCs will chop down forests and desert groves (Not orchards - 
     use farming without replanting for that).
  &ydigging:&0 NPCs will dig for rocks in any quarry, or clay in any clay pit.
  &yfarming:&0 NPCs will harvest crops. Costs no food.
  &yreplanting:&0 after farming crops, NPCs will replant them.
  &ymaintenance:&0 NPCs will keep buildings maintained.
  &ymining:&0 NPCs will mine your mines.
  &yscraping:&0 NPCs will convert trees into logs at lumber yards.
  &ysawing:&0 NPCs will convert trees into lumber at lumber yards.

  &yabandon-farmed:&0 NPCs will abandon a tile when they finish farming.
  &cnexus-crystal (skilled):&0 Will make nexus crystals at the sorcery tower;
     requires both Exarch Crafts and Skilled Labor.
  &ymilling:&0 Will mill grains into flour.
  &yrepair-vehicles&0: Will keep vehicles maintained.
  &yoilmaking:&0 Will press oil.
  
Items marked (skilled) require the Skilled Labor goal. Skilled Labor chores
tend to cost more food.

#
"WORKFORCE KEEP"

Usage:  workforce keep <item name>

This command will prevent your workers from using/eating an item in your
empire's inventory. You can specify more than one keyword if you're having
trouble targeting the right item.

This command only affects the island you are currently on. Using this command
again on the item will turn off 'keep'.

Examples:
 > workforce keep stick
 > workforce keep spruce lumber

See also: WORKFORCE
#
"WORKFORCE NO-WORK" "WORKFORCE NOWORK" NO-WORK NOWORK

Usage:  workforce no-work

This command toggles workforce for the map location you're standing on.
Citizens will not perform any chores at that location.

See also: WORKFORCE
#
"WORKFORCE WHERE"

Usage:  workforce where
        workforce where here

This command will show you how many of your citizens are working on each
active workforce chore right now.

If you use the "here" argument, it will only check the island you're on.

See also: WORKFORCE
#
"WORKFORCE WHY"

Usage:  workforce why [chore]
        workforce why [location | here]

This command will tell you why your workforce didn't work during the last hour.

Some possible reasons include:
 no workers - Make sure there are available citizens within 20 tiles.
 over limit - You have too much of what the chore would produce.
 depleted - The location is temporarily depleted.
 no resources - You are missing the items needed to build/craft.
 already sheared - Sheep sheared too recently.
 delayed - There was a recent problem and workforce must wait to resume.
 out of city - The building must be inside a city.

If a chore is marked "delayed", that means it failed on a previous attempt and
hasn't tried again yet. Chores are delayed by a few hours when they fail.
