STEALTH "STEALTH SKILL"

Stealth is the skill tree for all things secret, hidden, or shadow. Little is
known about its practitioners. Rumors swirl of an underground group of thieves
called the Guild, though no one dares confirm them.

(To begin your journey down the path of Stealth, try bribing the hidden guild-
master.)

NOTE: The Stealth tree is only partially implemented.

be marked internally as hostile for 1 hour, and become a valid PVP target. If
you die, any items stolen in the last 30 minutes will be left on your corpse.

This ability has two functions:

With Steal, you can pick up items from rooms that are claimed by other empires.
You do this with the "get" command. You can't steal from allies or people you
