STEALTH "STEALTH SKILL" STL

Stealth is the skill tree for all things secret, hidden, or shadow. Little is
known about its practitioners. Rumors swirl of an underground group of thieves
called the Guild, though no one dares confirm them.

You can get additional Stealth abilities when you reach level 100, depending on
which other skills you have at high levels. Use the 'role' command to choose
which set of skills to use.

(To begin your journey down the path of Stealth, try bribing the hidden guild-
master.)

INFILTRATE "IMPROVED INFILTRATE"

Infiltrate, Improved Infiltrate (Stealth abilities)

Usage:  infiltrate <direction>

Infiltrate allows you to enter buildings where you don't belong. You can't
infiltrate the buildings of people you have non-aggression pacts or alliances
with. You must have stealth permission from your empire, and infiltrating will
trigger distrust with the other empire. The empire will be alerted to your
presence as an infiltrator, so act fast.

Infiltrate will also allow you to enter portals in places that you don't have
permission to use.

Improved Infiltrate increases your chances of successful infiltration and
give you a chance to get in undetected. Even if you are detected, your identity
will not be revealed.

Note: Like many stealth actions, infiltrate cannot be used against an empire
which has no members online (unless you are at war or have a thievery permit).

Both abilities gain experience when you try to infiltrate somewhere.

#
PICKPOCKET "PICK POCKET"

Pickpocket (Stealth ability)

Usage:  pickpocket <victim>

A skilled thief can lift small items from an unsuspecting victim.

You can only pickpocket NPCs, and even then only human ones. This ability does
not remove items you see in their inventories, only "pocket items". The result
is largely random but often includes coins. Each NPC can only be pickpocketed
once.

Pickpocketing citizens of another empire counts as an act of hostility. Any
empire coins you receive from pickpocketing came from the empire's treasury
(if you are at war with that empire), and pickpocketing your own citizens
always takes coins from your own treasury.

NPCs more than 50 levels above you will always catch you if you try to
pickpocket them.

Gains experience when you try to pickpocket someone.
#
POISON POISONS "DEADLY POISONS" MIX

You can mix poisons with the "mix" command in an alchemist shop, or anywhere
you could brew a potion.

To set which poison you intend to use in combat, "use" the vial containing the
correct poison. Each time your weapon hits your opponent, you have a chance to
envenom them with your chosen poison. When the vial runs out of poison, it will
be removed from your inventory.

All vials have 15 charges. The Deadly Poisons ability makes all your poisons
50% more powerful (when the poison is applied; you won't see it on identify).
Poisons only work with sharp weapons. Poisons also count as Stealth debuffs,
and some NPCs are immune.

is resisted. You need to have these abilities in order both to create and to
use the poisons.
