"DAILY EXPERIENCE BONUS POINTS" "DAILY SKILLS" "BONUS EXPERIENCE POINTS" "DAILY BONUS EXPERIENCE POINTS"

Each day, you get a certain number of daily bonus experience points. While you
have any points left, you get 50x more skill experience from using your
abilities. When you run out of daily bonus experience, you will still continue
to gain skill levels, but at a slower rate.

Each time you gain a skill level, your daily bonus experience points will go
down by one. When they run out, the effect ends until the daily skill reset.

You can keep yourself from accidentally spending your daily bonus experience
in the wrong skill by using 'noskill'.

#
MINE MINES

Building:  &y/&0[]&y\&0  Mine  (no skill required)
Resources:  4 logs
Built on:  mountain
Command:  mine

"Mine" is both a building type, and the command to work in that building. Mines
must be built on mountains, and can only be entered from one side even before
you complete them. To work in a mine, you need a pick of some kind, although a
simple handaxe will also work. A better mining tool and more Strength will help
you mine faster, as will haste.

Mines have a limited amount of ore, and do not replenish. However, if you fully
dismantle a mine, its mountain will reset when the MUD celebrates a new year
(every 7.5 real days). Once this reset happens, building a new mine on the
tile will involve digging a new mine shaft and the mineral found there could be
completely different.

Mines count as in-city territory as far away as 3x a city's normal radius.

See HELP IRON GUIDE for help getting started on mining and using iron.

Types of mines:
  iron - very common
  copper - common
  silver - very uncommon
  gold - only found with Rare Metals
  nocturnium - only found with Rare Metals
  imperium - only found with Rare Metals

#
MORPH MORPHING SHAPESHIFTING

Usage:  morph <form>
        morph normal

a few seconds, but if you're in combat you can morph instantly at a higher
cost than normal.

Morphing will remove your disguise, if you have one.

See also: ANIMAL FORMS, WOLF FORM, BAT FORM, HORRID FORM, MIST FORM
#
NOSKILL

Usage:  noskill <skill>

You can toggle which skills will or will not gain for you. This helps you to
conserve the precious few bonus experience points you earn each day.

Use the "skills" command to see which are &cgaining&0 and which are &rnoskill&0.

See also: SKILLS
#
PLANT

Usage:  plant <seed/food>

You can replant crops in open fields so that they may regrow and be harvested
again. This is essential in keeping your crops from dying out.

Planting takes a little while, but you don't actually have to wait the whole
time. If you immediately stop planting, your character just scatters the seeds
and the crop will grow eventually. If you take care to plant neat rows, and
water them (let the planting action finish), the crop will grow very quickly.

#
SACRIFICE 

Usage:  sacrifice <item> <god>

Sacrifice is used to destroy an item in the favor of a specific god you
choose. This helps you by clearing up many unwanted items and resources.
This also may help you get favor with the god, and in turn, that god may help
you out with a little help. The sacrifice points are increased if the
sacrifice is performed in a shrine, temple, or high temple to that god. 

Example:  

  > sacrifice stick Exar 
#
SAW

have matching arrows in your inventory. You will attack with your arrows
one at a time, while the target runs at you. Once the target reaches you,
you will draw your weapon and begin melee battle. 

Example:

#
SKILL SKILLS ABILITY ABILITIES "SKILL BUY" "SKILL RESET" "SKILL LEVELS"

Usage:  skills -- list all skills
        skill <name> -- see abilities in that skill
        skill buy <ability> -- purchase an ability
        skill reset <skill> -- reset your ability points
        skill drop <skill> <level> -- lose skill levels

This multi-purpose command helps you understand your skills. It shows your
progress in each skill, and the ability points you've earned.

If you specify a skill, you'll see a breakdown of the abilities in that skill
tree. Abilities marked with an "x" are the ones you already know. To buy a new
ability, use "skill buy". You must have a free ability point to do this.

For more information, see the help page for each skill or ability. In some
cases, you may have to type "help skill empire" because "help empire" shows
something else, although this is the name of a skill.

When you hit a skill cap level (50, 75, 100) you get to reset your abilities
in that skill. To do that, you can type "skill reset <skill>". If you type it
without the skill name, you can see which skills have free resets available.

It also shows the range in which you can gain the skill, although you can gain
no more than 10 points from any one ability.

#
"SKILL CAPS" CAPS "MAX SKILL" "MAXIMUM SKILL" "CLASS SKILLS" "SPECIALTY SKILLS" "BASIC SKILLS"

Skills are capped at certain levels to limit the number of abilities any one
character can have. When you reach 50 or 75 in a skill, you will stop gaining
points in that skill. To choose that skill for further advancement as one of
your specialty or class skills, use the "specialize" command. This will get you
a free level in the skill.

* You can have two skills at 100. These are your class skills.
  These skills will get 15 abilities each.
* You can have one skill at 75. This is your specialty skill.
  These skills will get 12 abilities each.
* The rest of the skills are limited to 50. These are basic skills.
  These skills will get 9 abilities each.

You can get a second specialty skill (75) if you keep two of your skills at
zero (0). Once you have fewer than two skills at zero, you can no longer choose
to specialize an extra skill. The opposite is also true: if you specialize an
extra skill, you'll no longer be able to gain in your last two zeroes.

You can use 'skill drop' if you want to lower one of your skills so that you
can then start raising a different one.

See also: SKILLS, SKILL DROP, SPECIALIZE
#
"SKILL DROP"

Usage:  skill drop <skill> <level>

This command allows you to voluntary give up points in one of your skills.
You might do this because you accidentally raised one from 0, or because you
want to try a different specialty.

Once you use this command, those skill points are gone forever. You will also
lose any abilities you purchased above the new level.

See also: SKILL
#
"TRAINING SKILLS" "SKILL POINTS" "SKILL EXPERIENCE" "SKILLUPS" EXPERIENCE

The two ways to gain skill levels are:
- By using "yellow" abilities from the skill's tree (abilities that aren't at
  max).
- For skills under level 15, you can usually gain skill by doing "chores". See
  the help file for each skill tree for more information on leveling it.

Each skill has an experience rating, as a percentage. This is your chance to
gain a skill level each time you use one of the skill tree's abilities -- the
chance is checked any time you use an ability. You don't need to get the
experience all the way to 100%.

When your skills hit level 50 or 75, you will not be able to gain additional
levels in the skill unless you specialize into it. You won't gain skill from
using abilities on mobs and players who are more than 50 levels below you.

See also: SKILL CAPS, SPECIALIZE, SKILLS
#
SMELT MELT

Usage:  smelt <item>

Using a forge or foundry, you can melt down metals like iron, silver, and gold
into ingots or bars. Smelting generally requires two of the base metal (e.g.
iron ore) to create one of the processed version (iron ingot).

Ingots are used for crafting.

Gold and silver bars are worth more in the vault than their raw form. The bars
can be smelted again to return them to the smaller raw version.

See also: INGOTS, WEALTH
#
SPECIALIZE SPECIALTY

Usage:  specialize <skill>

This command allows you to choose which skills become your class skills and
specialties. You can only specialize a skill that's at 50 (the basic skill cap)
or 75 (the specialty skill cap). Doing this will gain you a free point in the
skill and allow you to continue leveling it.

NOTE: This is a temporary command. In the future, we intend to use quests and
other mechanisms for players who want to specialize.

#
"STARTING LOCATION" "START LOCATION" "TOWER OF SOULS" TRANSPORT TOS

Command:  transport [destination]

When you start, or die, you appear at a starting location. These are safe
locations which will give you a moment to prepare to go out into the world.
No player can be attacked at a starting location.

You can travel randomly between starting locations using the transport command.
Alternatively, you can give the coordinates of a starting location (or the name
of a person who is at one) to transport directly there.

On EmpireMUD, starting locations are called Towers of Souls. Nobody may claim
the area immediately around a Tower of Souls (&y*/\*&0).
#
SUMMON

Command:  summon <type>

The summon command is used by several different abilities to summon various
creatures, items, or bodyguards. Each may serve a different purpose, so you

SUMMON ANIMALS  (Natural Magic ability)
SUMMON GUARDS  (Empire ability)
SUMMON HUMANS  (Vampire ability)

Once you have sewn a tent, you can carry it with you in your inventory and set
it up or take it down using build and dismantle. The tent requires no add-
itional resources each time you set it up.

Building the tent will claim the land, just like any building command. When
you dismantle it later, be sure to abandon the claim.
