BOOKEDIT "BOOK EDIT"

Usage:  bookedit list -- list books you wrote
        bookedit copy <book> -- write out a fresh copy of one of your books
        bookedit write <book | new> -- edit a book

The bookedit command lets you create books to fill the world's libraries.
In order to work on books, you need to build a library -- one of the Grand
Monuments.

You can pick books for 'copy' and 'write' by name or number. The 'list' command
gives you the numbers.

When you use the 'write' command, it will take you to the book editor. This
editor has its own 'help' command to assist you in using it.

Steps to getting your book into a library:
1. Write the book using "bookedit write"
2. Make a physical copy of the book using "bookedit copy" (this takes a minute)
3. Take your copy to any library and type "library shelve" to put your book into
   circulation in that building
4. You can use "library checkout" to get another copy of your book out

Type "HELP BOOK TIPS" for more notes on book editing.

"BOOK TIPS"

These tips will help you with the BOOKEDIT command:

You set several properties:
- title: The story name as it appears in the library.
- byline: The author the story is credited to.
- item name: The way the item appears in your inventory ("a book")
- item description: How the book is described when you look at it.

Books are arranged into paragraphs which are shown to the reader every 20
seconds. You should keep each paragraph down to just a few lines. Since telnet
uses a standard 80-character display, you should keep your lines 80 characters
or less.

Type /c to clear the text editor when you start a new paragraph or description.
Otherwise, the default text will still be in there. You can use /d1 to delete
line 1 if you left it in anyway.

The easiest way to format your paragraphs is to type /fi in the text editor.
This also works on the item description. But if your whole text fits on 1 line
under 80 characters, you probably don't need the indent.

LIBRARY

Building:  [^^]  Library  (Grand Monuments)
Command:  library browse  -- see books shelved here
          library checkout <book>  -- grab a copy of a book
          library shelve <item>  -- put a book away on the shelves
          library burn <book>  -- remove all copies of a book from this library

You can collect books and put them into your own library, which is a Grand
Monument in the Empire skill tree. Once you shelve a book in your library, you
can take as many copies of it as you want. The only way to permanently remove
it form your collection is to use the "burn" command.

The 'checkout' and 'burn' commands target books in the library's collection,
not items in your inventory. You can pick these books by name or by number.
Use the 'browse' command to see the numbers, but beware that these may change
as new books are catalogued and sorted.

If you have written a book with bookedit, you can always make a new copy of it
using 'bookedit copy'.

citizens.

Unique, enchanted, superior, or otherwise-modified items can't be stored in
regular storage buildings, but you can store them with the "warehouse" command
in a warehouse or vault.

If you're visiting another empire, you can store and retrieve your own items
on credit from their public (or allied) buildings, IF you have a trade pact.

You can identify an item to see where it can be stored.

(Not to be confused with the Trade skill.)

You can post and buy trades at any Trading Post building. These trades are
global and can be bought from any trading post. See the individual help files
for notes on each trade command.

Expired or sold trades must be collected by the original poster within 30 days,
or they will be lost.

          TRADE IDENTIFY, TRADE POST
#
"TRADE CHECK"

Usage:  trade check [keywords]

Unlike other trade commands, you can use "trade check" from anywhere. It
tells you how your own posted trades are doing, and whether you have any money
to collect.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE COLLECT
#
"TRADE LIST"

Usage:  trade list [keywords]

This command lists items available for trade at the Trading Post. If you give
a set of keywords, it will only show items that match these keywords.

If the cost in your own local coins is different than the posted coin cost, the
cost to you will be given in parentheses.

The numbers on this list match up to the "trade buy" command if you use the
exact same set of keywords.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE BUY
#
"TRADE BUY"

Usage:  trade buy [number | keywords | number.keywords]

You can buy posted trades at any Trading Post. Use "trade list" to find the
correct number (but be aware it might change if something is purchased). If
you use "trade list" with the exact same set of keywords as trade buy, the
numbers will match up.

For example, if "trade list sword" shows the item you want at number 4, then
"trade buy 4.sword" will purchase it. You will receive the item immediately.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE BUY
#
"TRADE CANCEL"

Usage:  trade cancel [number | keywords | number.keywords]

If you posted a trade by accident, or want to re-post it at a different price,
you can cancel the trade at any time. You will lose the money you paid to post
it in the first place.

Cancelling a trade expires it immediately. You must use "trade collect" to get
the item back when you're done.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE COLLECT
#
"TRADE COLLECT"

Usage:  trade collect

This command retrieves all the money your trades have sold for, plus any
expired trade items you posted.

See also: TRADE COMMAND
#
"TRADE IDENTIFY"

Usage:  trade identify <item>

This command will get you full stats on an item up for trade.

See also:  TRADE COMMAND
#
"TRADE POST"

Usage:  trade post <item> <cost> [time]

You can post trade items from your inventory at any Trading Post. The cost you
specify will be in your own local currency (the currency of your empire if you
are in one, or in miscellaneous coins if not).

The time to post the item is in real hours, and defaults to the maximum post
time if you don't specify it. The minimum time is 1 hour.

You must pay a small fee to post an item, based on its gear level. You will get
this money back if your item sells successfully. However, there is a 5% charge
for each successful sale.

For example, if an item costs you 4 coins to post and you sell it for 10 coins,
You'll receive 9 coins (95% of the sale price) plus your original 4 back, for
a total of 13 coins.

VAULT WAREHOUSE

Building:  {WW}  Warehouse  (Artisans skill)
Built on:  plains, desert

Command:  warehouse inventory [item keywords]
          warehouse identify <item keywords>
          warehouse retrieve [number] <item keywords>
          warehouse store [number] <item keywords>

While normal resource storage (e.g. the lumber yard) can store many simple
items, you must use a warehouse or vault to store items which are unique,
scaled, enchanted, superior, or otherwise modified. Warehouse and vault storage
are identical except that the vault requires "withdraw" empire privilege to
use it, and warehouse only requires that you be a member of the empire. Both
use the "warehouse" command.

Items which can be stored in normal resource storage may not be stored using
the "warehouse" command. Also note that treasure (like gold bars) must be
stored in the vault using the regular "store" command, not "warehouse".

The "warehouse list" will give you a numbered list of things on your current
island that match the keywords (or all items if you don't give keywords). You
can choose which matching thing to retrieve, for example:
> warehouse inv sword
 1. a greatsword
 2. (2) a greatsword (enchanted)
 3. (4) a short sword
> warehouse retrieve 2.sword
You retrieve a greatsword (enchanted).
> warehouse retrieve all 3.sword
You retrieve a short sword (x4).

Note: Immortals can see the warehouse lists for other empires using the syntax
"warehouse inv <empire> [keywords]".
