"BUFF FOOD" "BUFF FOODS" "WELL FED" WELL-FED

Buff foods are foods that give you a bonus when you eat them. Unlike normal
foods, you can eat buff foods even if you're full -- but they will replace any
existing "well-fed" buff you already have.

You can only eat 24 hours' worth of a buff food at once, giving you a full day
(30 real minutes) of that food's effect. If less than 24 hours of food is left,
you will get a shorter effect instead.

If you become hungry, you'll lose your well-fed effect early.

the components from other players.

The first tier of crafter items comes at level 100:
  Head: clockwork goggles (requires a clockwork lens array from an Artificer)
  Clothes: guildmaster tunic (requires guild-patterned cloth from a Guildsman)
  Waist: utility belt (requires some clips and buckles from a Tinker)

KEEP UNKEEP

Usage:  keep <item>
        unkeep <item>

Setting an item to 'keep' will keep you from dropping, putting, giving,
or sacrificing it as part of a set of "all". This means if you 'keep' your
stone hammer, then type "drop all.stone", you won't drop the hammer -- only
other stone items.

You can still drop, give, put, or sacrifice a 'keep' item if you only target
one item at a time. That is, "drop hammer" will still drop the hammer even
though you marked it keep.

Items you 'keep' will have a (keep) tag next to their name. You can use
'unkeep' to unprotect an item. You can also 'keep all' and 'unkeep all' on
your inventory.

'Keep' will also prevent items from being used for crafting or building. You
can use this to avoid wasting more precious components when you have cheaper
ones available.

type of forest is extremely rare. To grow it, you must find the strange crystal
seed, enchant it (Enchant Tools), plant it, then use the chant of nature to
grow it.

Enchanted Forests are protected from over-chopping because they will grow back
even from stumps. Be sure to claim the forest, though, as necrovandal cultists
will quickly detect and destroy any unclaimed enchanted forest tiles.

The only way to remove the forest tiles is to abandon them and let the necro-
vandals destroy them.

This wood is generally used in crafts in the 200-300 level range.

legendary artisan. Crafts that require tools, such as forge, will go faster
if the tool you use is superior. Scaled items such as armor and weapons will

from, everything you make will be masterwork.

  Forge - Master Blacksmith
  Pottery - Master Craftsman
  Woodworking - Master Craftsman
  Healing Elixirs and Wrath of Nature Potions are masterworks if you have both

for notes on each trade command.

Expired or sold trades must be collected by the original poster within 30 days,
or they will be lost.

          TRADE IDENTIFY, TRADE POST

tells you how your own posted trades are doing, and whether you have any money
to collect.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE COLLECT
#
"TRADE LIST"

Usage:  trade list [keywords]

This command lists items available for trade at the Trading Post. If you give
a set of keywords, it will only show items that match these keywords.

If the cost in your own local coins is different than the posted coin cost, the
cost to you will be given in parentheses.

The numbers on this list match up to the "trade buy" command if you use the
exact same set of keywords.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE BUY
#
"TRADE BUY"

Usage:  trade buy [number | keywords | number.keywords]

You can buy posted trades at any Trading Post. Use "trade list" to find the
correct number (but be aware it might change if something is purchased). If
you use "trade list" with the exact same set of keywords as trade buy, the
numbers will match up.

For example, if "trade list sword" shows the item you want at number 4, then
"trade buy 4.sword" will purchase it. You will receive the item immediately.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE BUY
#
"TRADE CANCEL"

Usage:  trade cancel [number | keywords | number.keywords]

If you posted a trade by accident, or want to re-post it at a different price,
you can cancel the trade at any time. You will lose the money you paid to post
it in the first place.

Canceling a trade expires it immediately. You must use "trade collect" to get
the item back when you're done.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE COLLECT
#
"TRADE COLLECT"

Usage:  trade collect

This command retrieves all the money your trades have sold for, plus any
expired trade items you posted.

This command will get you full stats on an item up for trade.

See also:  TRADE COMMAND
#
"TRADE POST"

Usage:  trade post <item> <cost> [time]

You can post trade items from your inventory at any Trading Post. The cost you
specify will be in your own local currency (the currency of your empire if you
are in one, or in miscellaneous coins if not).

The time to post the item is in real hours, and defaults to the maximum post
time if you don't specify it. The minimum time is 1 hour.

You must pay a small fee to post an item, based on its gear rating. You will
get this money back if your item sells successfully. However, there is a 5%
charge for each successful sale.

For example, if an item costs you 4 coins to post and you sell it for 10 coins,
You'll receive 9 coins (95% of the sale price) plus your original 4 back, for
a total of 13 coins.

VAULT

Building:  Vault (designated)
Designated in:  portcullis, great hall

Command:  deposit <number> [empire] <coins>
          warehouse <action> <item keywords>

Having a vault allows you to store coins and precious metals, both for trading
and to accumulate wealth for your empire. It also offers a more secure version
of warehouse storage.

Warehouse and vault storage for unique items are identical except that the
vault requires "withdraw" empire privilege to use it, and warehouse only
requires the "warehouse" privilege. Both use the "warehouse" command.

Items which can be stored in normal resource storage may not be stored using
the "warehouse" command. Also note that treasure (like gold bars) must be
stored in the vault using the regular "store" command, not "warehouse".

          warehouse identify <item keywords>
          warehouse retrieve [number] <item keywords>
          warehouse store [number] <item keywords>

While normal resource storage (e.g. the lumber yard) can store many simple
items, you must use a warehouse (or vault) to store items which are unique,
scaled, enchanted, superior, or otherwise modified.

You must have the "warehouse" empire privilege to withdraw items from warehouse
storage. Items which can be stored in normal resource storage may not be stored
using the "warehouse" command.

The "warehouse list" will give you a numbered list of things on your current
island that match the keywords (or all items if you don't give keywords). You
can choose which matching thing to retrieve, for example:
> warehouse inv sword
 1. a greatsword
 2. (2) a greatsword (enchanted)
 3. (4) a short sword
> warehouse retrieve 2.sword
You retrieve a greatsword (enchanted).
> warehouse retrieve all 3.sword
You retrieve a short sword (x4).

Note: Immortals can see the warehouse lists for other empires using the syntax
"warehouse inv <empire> [keywords]".
