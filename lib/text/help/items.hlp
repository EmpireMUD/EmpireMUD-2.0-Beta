"CRAFTER ITEMS" "CRAFTING ITEMS" "CRAFT ITEMS" "CRAFTING LEVEL" "CRAFTER LEVEL" "CRAFT LEVEL"

A character's crafts (forge, sew, craft, etc.) are scaled up to the character's
crafting level. This level is shown on your 'score' as Crafting. This is based
on the character's skill level (1-100) plus bonuses from gear.

Crafter items come in four different equipment slots: head, clothes, waist, and
off-hand (hold). You can get a new set of crafter items every 100 levels or so.
You must always make your own crafter items, but you may need to buy some of
the components from other players.

The first tier of crafter items comes at level 100:
  Head: clockwork goggles (requires a clockwork lens array from an Artificer)
  Clothes: guildmaster tunic (requires guild-patterned cloth from a Guildsman)
  Waist: utility belt (requires some clips and buckles from a Tinker)
  Off-hand: steel multitool (needs a set of delicate tools from a Steelsmith)

#
"DROP FLAGS" "LOOT QUALITY FLAGS" "HARD DROP" "GROUP DROP" "GENERIC DROP" HARD-DROP GROUP-DROP GENERIC-DROP 

Items dropped by enemies intended for larger groups are usually slightly more
powerful than others of the same level, to compensate for the increased
difficulty of obtaining them. This is represented by a note based on the group
size recommended to fight the mob, displayed when the item is identified.

Items which can be obtained from enemies of varying difficulties are often not
eligible for these flags, and are indicated by a GENERIC-DROP flag.

#
KEEP UNKEEP

Usage:  keep <item>
        unkeep <item>

Setting an item to 'keep' will keep you from dropping, putting, giving,
or sacrificing it as part of a set of "all". This means if you 'keep' your
stone hammer, then type "drop all.stone", you won't drop the hammer -- only
other stone items.

You can still drop, give, put, or sacrifice a 'keep' item if you only target
one item at a time. That is, "drop hammer" will still drop the hammer even
though you marked it keep.

Items you 'keep' will have a (keep) tag next to their name. You can use
'unkeep' to unprotect an item. You can also 'keep all' and 'unkeep all' on
your inventory.
#
LARGE "LARGE ITEMS" "LARGE FLAG" (LARGE)

The (large) flag on items indicates that the item is over-sized and takes up

RETRIEVE

Usage:  retrieve <item>
        retrieve [number] <item>
        retrieve all

This command is used to get items from a storage building. You may use
"retrieve all" to fill up your inventory with items, but may not specify which
item to retrieve if you do.

If you don't have the "storage" empire privilege, you can't retrieve items
(although you can store them).

If you're visiting another empire, you can store and retrieve your own items
on credit from their public (or allied) buildings, IF you have a trade pact.

#
SPLIT

Usage:  split <amount> <type> coins

You can split coins you've found with members of your group using this command.

rounded down if there isn't an even amount to split, and you will keep the
difference.

Example:
> split 10 misc coins

#
STORE STORAGE

Usage:  store <item>
        store <number> <item>
        store all

It is recommended that you keep most of your extra resources stored. Items left
on the ground in claimed territory will eventually be stored by the empire's
citizens.

If you don't have the "storage" empire privilege, you can store items, but
can't retrieve them.

Unique, enchanted, superior, or otherwise-modified items can't be stored in
regular storage buildings, but you can store them with the "warehouse" command
in a warehouse or vault.

If you're visiting another empire, you can store and retrieve your own items
on credit from their public (or allied) buildings, IF you have a trade pact.

You can identify an item to see where it can be stored.

#
SUPERIOR MASTERWORK

The (superior) flag indicates that an item is a masterwork, crafted by a truly
legendary artisan. Crafts that require tools, such as forge, will go faster
if the tool you use is superior. Scaled items such as armor and weapons will
be better in their superior form than without it, even at the same level.

Masterwork abilities:
  Sewing/Leatherworking - Master Tailor
  Forge - Master Blacksmith
  Pottery - Master Craftsman
  Woodworking - Master Craftsman
  Healing Elixirs and Wrath of Nature Potions are masterworks if you have both

        trade collect
        trade identify <number | keywords | number.keywords>
        trade post <item> <cost> [time]

(Not to be confused with the Trade skill.)

You can post and buy trades at any Trading Post building. These trades are
global and can be bought from any trading post. See the individual help files
for notes on each trade command.

Expired or sold trades must be collected by the original poster within 30 days,
or they will be lost.

See also: TRADING POST
See also: TRADE CHECK, TRADE LIST, TRADE BUY, TRADE CANCEL, TRADE COLLECT,
          TRADE IDENTIFY, TRADE POST
#
"TRADE CHECK"

Usage:  trade check [keywords]

Unlike other trade commands, you can use "trade check" from anywhere. It
tells you how your own posted trades are doing, and whether you have any money
to collect.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE COLLECT
#
"TRADE LIST"

Usage:  trade list [keywords]

This command lists items available for trade at the Trading Post. If you give
a set of keywords, it will only show items that match these keywords.

If the cost in your own local coins is different than the posted coin cost, the
cost to you will be given in parentheses.

The numbers on this list match up to the "trade buy" command if you use the
exact same set of keywords.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE BUY
#
"TRADE BUY"

Usage:  trade buy [number | keywords | number.keywords]

You can buy posted trades at any Trading Post. Use "trade list" to find the
correct number (but be aware it might change if something is purchased). If
you use "trade list" with the exact same set of keywords as trade buy, the
numbers will match up.

For example, if "trade list sword" shows the item you want at number 4, then
"trade buy 4.sword" will purchase it. You will receive the item immediately.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE BUY
#
"TRADE CANCEL"

Usage:  trade cancel [number | keywords | number.keywords]

If you posted a trade by accident, or want to re-post it at a different price,
you can cancel the trade at any time. You will lose the money you paid to post
it in the first place.

Canceling a trade expires it immediately. You must use "trade collect" to get
the item back when you're done.

See also: TRADE COMMAND, TRADE COLLECT
#
"TRADE COLLECT"

Usage:  trade collect

This command retrieves all the money your trades have sold for, plus any
expired trade items you posted.

See also: TRADE COMMAND
#
"TRADE IDENTIFY"

Usage:  trade identify <item>

This command will get you full stats on an item up for trade.

See also:  TRADE COMMAND
#
"TRADE POST"

Usage:  trade post <item> <cost> [time]

You can post trade items from your inventory at any Trading Post. The cost you
specify will be in your own local currency (the currency of your empire if you
are in one, or in miscellaneous coins if not).

The time to post the item is in real hours, and defaults to the maximum post
time if you don't specify it. The minimum time is 1 hour.

You must pay a small fee to post an item, based on its gear rating. You will
get this money back if your item sells successfully. However, there is a 5%
charge for each successful sale.

For example, if an item costs you 4 coins to post and you sell it for 10 coins,
You'll receive 9 coins (95% of the sale price) plus your original 4 back, for
a total of 13 coins.

#
VAULT

Building:  Vault (designated)
Designated in:  portcullis, great hall

Command:  deposit <number> [empire] <coins>
          warehouse <action> <item keywords>

Having a vault allows you to store coins and precious metals, both for trading
and to accumulate wealth for your empire. It also offers a more secure version
of warehouse storage.

Warehouse and vault storage for unique items are identical except that the
vault requires "withdraw" empire privilege to use it, and warehouse only
requires the "warehouse" privilege. Both use the "warehouse" command.

Items which can be stored in normal resource storage may not be stored using
the "warehouse" command. Also note that treasure (like gold bars) must be
stored in the vault using the regular "store" command, not "warehouse".

See also: CASTLE, DESIGNATE, PRIVILEGE, RETRIEVE, STORE, WAREHOUSE
#
WAREHOUSE

Building:  {WW}  Warehouse  (Artisans skill)
Resources:  20 lumber, 8 nails
Built on:  plains, desert

Command:  warehouse inventory [item keywords]
          warehouse identify <item keywords>
          warehouse retrieve [number] <item keywords>
          warehouse store [number] <item keywords>

While normal resource storage (e.g. the lumber yard) can store many simple
items, you must use a warehouse (or vault) to store items which are unique,
scaled, enchanted, superior, or otherwise modified.

You must have the "warehouse" empire privilege to withdraw items from warehouse
storage. Items which can be stored in normal resource storage may not be stored
using the "warehouse" command.

The "warehouse list" will give you a numbered list of things on your current
island that match the keywords (or all items if you don't give keywords). You
can choose which matching thing to retrieve, for example:
> warehouse inv sword
 1. a greatsword
 2. (2) a greatsword (enchanted)
 3. (4) a short sword
> warehouse retrieve 2.sword
You retrieve a greatsword (enchanted).
> warehouse retrieve all 3.sword
You retrieve a short sword (x4).

Note: Immortals can see the warehouse lists for other empires using the syntax
"warehouse inv <empire> [keywords]".
